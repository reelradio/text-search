Murray the K got started working for song writer Bob Merrill When Artie Altro was 14 years old he went to a rehearsal of The Perry Como Show at CBS Studio 52 While there his picture was taken with The Fontane Sisters by Bob Merrill who was not only a top song writer but worked as a utility man on the show keeping the camera cable clear Artie started in the business as a Disc Jockey (morning man) in August 1960 at WDOR in Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin After two years he moved on to WREB in Holyoke Mass for a short time then to WFAS in White Plains which was close to his home and close to New York City Artie says I studied acting for a while in New York before going to work as an engineer with WOR FM in 1966 when the FM s were being separated from the AM stations There I worked with the original 4 disc jockeys: Murray the K Scott Muni Rosko (Bill Mercer) and Johnny Michaels It was Johnny Michaels who got me the job We worked together at WFAS A lot of radio history was made at WOR FM It was the first FM station to play rock n roll and it was one of the first FM stations to make money In reality it put FM on the map Back then many people did not have FM radios The first anniversary party for WOR FM was at a small theater in Greenwich Village which later became the Fillmore East and the headliner on the first anniversary show was Jim Morrison and the Doors Not long after one enjoyable year programmer Bill Drake took over programming the station The disc jockeys knew they wouldn t fit and didn t want to fit in the Bill Drake format It was a very restrictive format in what they could play and what they could say The DJ s all quit and were replaced by people hand picked by Bill Drake himself I became supervisor and production engineer Every piece of production during the Bill Drake years passed through my hands In 1969 I produced a three hour Public service special about Childhood Autism The special won the Major Armstrong Award for excellence in FM programming and the AMA Award for calling attention to a little known illness One of the guests on the show was Ruth Sullivan founder and first president of the National Society for Autistic Children It was Ruth Sullivan and her autistic son that Dustin Hoffman spent a lot of time with researching his part in Rainman and it was Ruth Sullivan s son who Dustin Hoffman copied for his character in the movie In 1978 when radio was downsizing I was transferred to WOR TV which later became WWOR TV During my time there I was video tape engineer for Joe Franklin Morton Downey Jr Howard Stern and Richard Bey I have a good collection of out takes from these shows but because of copyright reasons I can t do much with them right now I first met Mort in 1954 It was at a Wallach s clothing store in White Plains NY He was a 22 year old

Murray the K got started working for song writer Bob Merrill When Artie Altro was 14 years old he went to a rehearsal of The Perry Como Show at CBS Studio 52 While there his picture was taken with The Fontane Sisters by Bob Merrill who was not only a top song writer but worked as a utility man on the show keeping the camera cable clear Artie started in the business as a Disc Jockey (morning man) in August 1960 at WDOR in Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin After two years he moved on to WREB in Holyoke Mass for a short time then to WFAS in White Plains which was close to his home and close to New York City Artie says I studied acting for a while in New York before going to work as an engineer with WOR FM in 1966 when the FM s were being separated from the AM stations There I worked with the original 4 disc jockeys: Murray the K Scott Muni Rosko (Bill Mercer) and Johnny Michaels It was Johnny Michaels who got me the job We worked together at WFAS A lot of radio history was made at WOR FM It was the first FM station to play rock n roll and it was one of the first FM stations to make money In reality it put FM on the map Back then many people did not have FM radios The first anniversary party for WOR FM was at a small theater in Greenwich Village which later became the Fillmore East and the headliner on the first anniversary show was Jim Morrison and the Doors Not long after one enjoyable year programmer Bill Drake took over programming the station The disc jockeys knew they wouldn t fit and didn t want to fit in the Bill Drake format It was a very restrictive format in what they could play and what they could say The DJ s all quit and were replaced by people hand picked by Bill Drake himself I became supervisor and production engineer Every piece of production during the Bill Drake years passed through my hands In 1969 I produced a three hour Public service special about Childhood Autism The special won the Major Armstrong Award for excellence in FM programming and the AMA Award for calling attention to a little known illness One of the guests on the show was Ruth Sullivan founder and first president of the National Society for Autistic Children It was Ruth Sullivan and her autistic son that Dustin Hoffman spent a lot of time with researching his part in Rainman and it was Ruth Sullivan s son who Dustin Hoffman copied for his character in the movie In 1978 when radio was downsizing I was transferred to WOR TV which later became WWOR TV During my time there I was video tape engineer for Joe Franklin Morton Downey Jr Howard Stern and Richard Bey I have a good collection of out takes from these shows but because of copyright reasons I can t do much with them right now I first met Mort in 1954 It was at a Wallach s clothing store in White Plains NY He was a 22 year old

York in 1981 and most recently was working as the voice of CBS Sports in New York Murray the K and Johnny Michaels also left WOR FM for the same reasons Scott Muni was the only one left Bill Drake was afraid he would have to wait until the end of Scott s contract so he cut a personalized ID for Scott Muni which was never used because Scott didn t want to work the format either Something was worked out between Scott & management Scott moved on to WNEW FM in New York where he worked for 31 years He moved to WAXQ FM in 1999 for a daily one hour show and passed away on September 28 2004 William

I was hired? But I was due to return to KXOA once my Army obligation was over As I fumbled for a piece of paper Johnny became more emphatic I need you at KROY We ll see you on August 2nd! At this point I had no idea what a mega station KROY had become in my two years absence So I naively said okay see you on the 2nd And that s how I got the best radio job in my 34 year career I didn t start out in radio being Wonder Rabbit I started by using my real name Martin Ashley Hell all my friends knew Martin but who knew Wonder Rabbit? Funny thing about nicknames Most stick for life After a few months at KROY as me I was posting a PSA in the control room when our midday Jock Bob Sherwood cracks open the microphone and says Bob Sherwood 1969 Bob Sherwood 1969 and Wonder Rabbit will be here tomorrow night at seven Earlier that day he had crossed out my humorous Wonder Boy notation on a PSA and changed it to Rabbit The following week we got new top of the hour ID s As a joke the station voice and consultant Graham Richards recorded one that said And now another Music Power Hour with Wonder Rabbit!

Having them as neighbors sparked my early interest in radio and throughout high school and college I was a true radio freak and gathered a lot of aircheck tape At Indiana University in Bloomington Indiana I majored in Radio TV/Journalism and spent a lot of time at the student carrier current station WIUS We actively sought ties to the real world of radio and some great people like WIBC WNAP/Indianapolis execs Jim Hilliard and George Johns and WAKY/Louisville PD Johnny Randolph came to Bloomington to visit us After college I took a stab at the DJ life doing mornings at WFLI/Chattanooga Production Director at 15Q (WKVQ)/Knoxville and then overnights at WMEE/Ft Wayne Indiana Gradually I got the message I was not made out to be a star jock so in 1977 I shifted to what became my real calling in radio news I was an anchor and reporter for large and respected newsrooms at WHO/Des Moines and WIRE/Indianapolis Then in 1982 I moved to Denver where I had long been drawn by the skiing and mountain recreation lifestyle I was also pretty tired of moving by then and vowed to stay in the Rockies no matter what In Denver I was an anchor/reporter at KNUS KHOW and News Director at public radio KCFR FM I also did a short stint as a TV assignment Editor As radio news started shrinking in the 80 s I started looking for another career but continued to do news part time into the 90 s at KBCO FM and the legendary KOA/Denver My combined experience in broadcasting and journalism was good preparation for work as a Recruiter/Headhunter for emerging technology industries I became a Technical Recruiter for the Telecom industry in 1996 and I helped find and hire people for companies such as Qwest Communications Even though radio lost so much individuality in the consolidations of the 80 s and 90 s it s still a kind of magical medium for me and I treasure my work in it My aircheck collection preserves some great memories of the industry that I loved to be part of The Repository thanks Greg Barman for sharing!

[PARENTAL ADVISORY: Profanity] On January 2nd 1971 the FCC ban on commercial advertising for cigarette products on radio and television went into effect The tobacco companies attributed much of their income from exposure on radio & TV There was great concern that there would be a loss of sales due to the lack of such advertising To address this opportunity a radio programming format calling itself RADIO NORTH AMERICA was born PlayPoints PLAY B Mitchel Reed (at 0:00) PLAY Wolfman Jack (at 08:27) PLAY The Real Don Steele (at 16:33) RNA would consist of four radio superstars: Dick Biondi Wolfman Jack B Mitchel Reed and The Real Don Steele doing their own shows via overnight radio playing top 40 music  except for Reed who would be playing progressive rock All four jocks would originate their shows out of Los Angeles but their radio signal would come from transmitters based in Mexico The incentive was to use RNA to advertise cigarettes on the radio Since the transmitters were licensed in Mexico they would be out of the FCC s power to ban such ads Not only that their superpower AM signals could reach a wide section of the country To sell this idea to tobacco companies and advertising agencies a multi media presentation was produced by Cherrytree Productions (now defunct) of Los Angeles Within this presentation 16mm footage shot of the four DJ s would be included In reality the four jocks were in a studio set of a radio station and their patter was not actual broadcasts just a mock show RNA never came to be and the project was abandoned These airchecks are all from broadcasts that never were All recordings came from the master Nagra 1/4 reel to reel tapes used as the soundtrack to the film for the presentation reel [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository stereo web tv compatible STEREO WebTV Compatible (9 Khz) [play gif] Phillips and Wall KSLQ FM St Louis December 12 1980 (40:26) Play Scoped This Exhibit SCOPED (22:15) [Description by contributor Rich Borowy] Oh Look! There s some sailors down there Guy Phillips and Mike Wall were a successful CHR morning team on KSLQ FM in St Louis a few years before The Morning Zoo in New York But their early success undoubtedly inspired a few of those Morning Zoo/Rude Awakening/Morning Sickness type radio teams that littered the FM landscape in 1980 s Usually set in teams of two these two guys (yep it really was an old boys club since very few females took part) would read humorous news reports from Reuters banter with jokes and gags and frequently had characters join in And there were time and weather checks traffic reports sports and  they would play music too! As of 2006 there is a KSLQ FM licensed in Washington Missouri I don t know anything about Wall but Phillips is still on the air in St Louis over KYKY FM the new call letters for what was once KSLQ He does a morning show called Phillips and Friends with four other personalities [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository stereo web tv compatible STEREO WebTV Compatible (14 Khz) [play gif] Hank Hayes WHOT 91 5 FM Brooklyn NY June 1989 (15:31) [Description by contributor Rich Borowy] This is the Federal Communications Commission We know who you are we re gonna getcha This has to be one of the more unusual airchecks I have received in my time The guy that went under the air name of Hank Hayes really loved radio Growing up in Brooklyn he heard all of the great jocks and stations from New York He and his buddies would have liked to work in radio but radio was beginning to sound bland with robot DJ s playing tunes that were selected by bean counters hired by big media conglomerates that didn t know what their own stations were playing! So to keep that classic sound they set up their own pirate FM station from their high rise apartment building near Coney Island Yes the FCC heard their broadcasts and issued a cease and desist order to stop broadcasts They were eventually raided by the Feds taking away all of their equipment and transmitter In this recording Hank presents his show complete with reverb and custom made PAMS jingles!

The lyrics: WHB reminds you faith is the strength of America Wow These PAMS jingles represent a era in Top 40 radio that has been all but lost in the formidable shadow of Drake and post Drake radio I m delighted to provide this montage here as it represents an important phase in the evolution of the format [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] Robert W Morgan KHJ/Los Angeles Spring 1967 (14:46) Harper s Bizarre Harper s Bizarre Harper s Bizarre Harper s Bizarre There They made me say that five hundred times [Description by Randy Brown] This is the first aircheck I ever heard in my life and remains to this day my all time favorite KUDL PD Dave Shaw (God rest his soul) made a copy of this tape when he was at KAKC/Tulsa and took it with him to Kansas City (which is where I first heard it) As the story goes Bill Drake brought this aircheck with him from Los Angeles to Tulsa and played it for the KAKC staff saying THIS is what a disc jockey should sound like A pretty strong statement and I couldn t agree more From the first time I heard this aircheck Robert W Morgan was my idol He remains to this day the best jock I ve ever heard period (Much More Morgan at www robertwmorgan com ) [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 16Kbps (8Khz) [play gif] Lee Bayley Farewell KAKC Tulsa 1971 (02:04) I m gonna hang up my rock n roll shoes [Description by Randy Brown] For seven years listeners to The Big 97 awoke to the sound of Lee Bayley on KAKC Though there are only two breaks on this tape Lee s farewell to his audience captures the genuineness that helped make him #1 [Uncle Ricky notes: Lee Bayley was V P of programming for Drake Chenault until 1978 and consulted over 600 radio stations in 20 years He passed away February 18 2013 ] [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] Beau Weaver KNUS Dallas 1972 Grammy Awards (12:48) the Academy is made up of what we call uptown hipsters or something [Description by Randy Brown] Several of the jocks and their wives were at my house playing Yatzee (yeah that s my story and I m stickin to it) when we heard Beau Weaver break format on KNUS and do an impromptu hour shortly after the 1972 Grammy Awards concluded We were soooooo heavy back then [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] KNUS Dallas Presentation 1973 (11:32) An FM station will never beat an AM station KLIF management [Description by Randy Brown] This was the first station presentation tape produced for KNUS after Gordon McLendon sold sister KLIF Narration is by Michael Spears who was known at the time as Hal Martin Interestingly the comments about KNUS attributed to others were voiced by impersonators though I think the statute of limitations has run out Contains airchecks of both Beau Weaver and me Christopher Haze [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 16Kbps (8Khz) [play gif] Christopher Haze XEROK 80 December 1973 (3:54) It s seven o clock and this is oops I can t tell you who I am [Description by Randy Brown] Several of us from KNUS/Dallas moved to El Paso to launch X ROK 80 When we arrived we found an old run down facility with one working studio It would be a two month wait before we actually went on the air with our new format The local radio community was abuzz with rumors about what we d do and we decided to fan the flames a bit by broadcasting random hours of sneak preview programming A Mexican radio station XEROK was required to broadcast at least 50% Spanish language programming unless it was pre recorded We got around this regulation by pre recording all our programming one day before it aired That s right we d go in on Monday to do our Tuesday shows and so forth No news no weather no PSAs No FCC either so no problem We also had another advantage signal At the same time we were waiting to flip the format we were also waiting for our new 150 thousand watt transmitter which according to Continental Electronics would provide a local grade signal at night from downtown San Francisco to downtown New Orleans Yikes!!

[Description by contributor Don Blesse] As a jingle collector for almost thirty years and an aficionado for even longer I ve noted over the years the myriad of jingles produced for radio stations about the communities in which they re located This collection highlights some of the better examples The long and the short  from the 50 s to the present  from the serious to sublime  and from the various production houses that existed over the years One of the more ambitious early projects was PAMS Series 16 Sound Of The City This 1960 package sought to link the station to the community it served It also featured a record length song about the city which some stations added to their song rotations and distributed as 45 rpm records KNUZ in Houston sold over 4 000 copies in a week! The genre flourished during the mid 60 s with some memorable songs from the likes of Sande & Greene Chuck Blore and Hugh Heller While 70 s radio was generally characterized by short jingles or none at all projects like TM s Sound Of Chicago and Listen To Your City and JAM s I d Rather Be series kept radio listeners singing about their towns The songs have kept on coming and you ll hear works from the 80 s and 90 s as well OUR KIND OF TOWN RADIO JINGLES THAT CELEBRATE THE PLACES WE LIVE The final cut is a custom cut done by JAM in 1979 for WYNY New York By length and production value alone it would have already been a contender as the grand finale The events of September 2001 however make it a particularly appropriate ending for such a compilation Thanks go to Mike Neff Mark Biviano Bill Schenold Kevin Slater and others who have contributed material over the years that went into this collection as well as Tom Corbett and Jonathan Wolfert who assisted in identifying some of the cuts The audio quality varies Some cuts are first generation dubs from the masters or digital clones from CD Others show the effects of multi generation dubbing magnetic tape deterioration or simply the archaic recording technology of their time We hope you ll forgive a little harmonic distortion here and there STATION/CLENT MARKET PRODUCER PACKAGE Cleveland Broadcasters Cleveland Chuck Blore custom KBOX Dallas PAMS Series 16 WCFL Chicago Chuck Blore Encore WABC New York PAMS Series 33A WWWE Cleveland PAMS Smilin Thru KGW Portland PAMS Series 28X WPRO Providence PAMS Series 47 WMID Atlantic City PAMS Series 22 KNUZ Houston PAMS Series 16 WTVN Columbus TM Sound Of Chicago WSPD Toledo MusiCreations Voice Of The City WCFL Chicago Chuck Blore Encore CKGM Montreal JAM I d Rather Be 2 KNX Los Angeles Chuck Blore custom WKBW Buffalo JAM Pro Radio KHOW Denver JAM We Love You KYA San Francisco Chuck Blore Encore WGY Schenectdady JAM I d Rather Be In Denver KDKA Pittsburgh TM BZ 73 WIND Chicago Heller custom WHDH Boston TM Boston Is Beautiful WPLJ New York TM/Century Big Time Radio WHEN Syracuse PAMS Winter WMGK Philadelphia JAM The Magic Is The Music KIMN Denver JAM I d Rather Be In Denver WCBS FM New York Chuck Blore custom KIIS Los Angeles PAMS Kiss 70 WHN New York Heller custom WBT Charlotte PAMS Series 34A WNDE Indianapolis JAM Windy Songs WCFL Chicago TM Charisma WLW Cincinnati Heller custom WNEW New York Sande & Greene custom Ohio Historical Society Columbus TM custom WDAE Tampa TM ?

This remains a well preserved piece of history When listening to Radio Luxembourg from just about anywhere in Europe it faded in and out terribly due to its 208 frequency so it is fabulous to hear it so clearly from that era David Gell Excerpted from: Who s Who in Radio Luxembourg DAVID GELL Canadian born David had an incredibly early introduction to the world of broadcasting  he first stood before a microphone when he was eight years old! Born on August 23 1929 David pursued this ambition further when at high school in Calgary When he left school he became a full time staff announcer on CFAC Calgary s top radio station David graduated with two degrees in Political Economy and Commerce David was foreign correspondent in Paris for Station CFAC and traveled extensively throughout Europe In 1955 a vacancy arose at Radio Luxembourg for a summer replacement DJ and so successful was David during his three year stint that he was asked to stay on permanently Today he is a freelance but does the major part of his work for Luxembourg including some enormously popular record shows [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 44 1 Kbps (13 Khz) [play gif] PAMS Series 26 KJR Seattle Sampler 1964 (02:09) Heaven help the foes of Washington [iplay gif] Description by Uncle Ricky Here s a short sampler of PAMS Series 26 ( Let s Go America ) for KJR Seattle These jingles were originally part of the first custom package for WABC New York Shortly after the New York debut the expanded series was also sold to KFWB in Los Angeles We don t know the actual date when KJR started airing these but are guessing 1964 a year after they appeared in NY and LA [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 20 7 Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] Gary Shannon KJR Seattle Top Ten of 1969 (06:44) I can t wait for the Seventies Taped by David Critchfield using a KENWOOD AM/FM receiver SONY reel to reel component deck and SONY 7 reel at 3 3/4 ips hence the tape quality survived much better after over thirty years on the shelf! Noteworthy for the nighttime 5 000 watt KJR reception from Bellingham about 90 miles north of the KJR transmitter on Harbor Island Seattle The AM atmospheric conditions certainly add ambiance recalling the days before ubiquitous FM cable or satellite reception of today About four years later I met Gary Shannon in person at KJR when I was doing a communications term paper at the University of Washington and I must have the interview with him on tape somewhere Gary gave me information about the history of KJR and some insights into the current state of the station at that time In a walk around the station I remember meeting Kevin O Brien on the air at the time who later became the PD at WNBC (if I remember correctly ) He was constantly turning the turntables slightly to verify that the 45s were cued up properly (amazing to remember when it used to be 45s!)

Miami DJs said they could walk from one Americana hotel room to another and have their pick So when I got to Miami big time DJs like Alan Freed and Bruce Morrow were in hiding from the payola investigation None of em made the ratings against us regulars The kids thought Cousin Brucie was corny for example I got my job at WAME because it was harboring one of those northern stars in hiding Mickey Shorr from Detroit had never worked his own board and for some reason couldn t learn When I walked in unshaven PD Fred Hall was wearing shorts a t shirt and old WWII rubber Air Corps earphones on his head He put on my audition tape grabbed both my paws and shouted emotionally I like your hands kid I like your hands! I got the job because I could cue up a tape and get a record to play at the right speed They were desperate and as they say: being there at the right time [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (8 Khz) [play gif] Dick Moore KBOX Dallas Action Central News November 1961 (04:24) Now Dallas you have heard THE news [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Bill Deane] From the reverberating canyons of the Cold War Dallas newsman Dick Moore is showcased in KBOX Action Central News New York Supertalent To Be Dan Ingram is featured on the pre recorded production elements and even though this KBOX news presentation isn t quite as elaborate as WFUN Fundamental News the manic energy and ominous delivery is decidedly full throttle [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 44 Kbps (13 Khz) [play gif] Bill Deane WFUN Miami December 1961 (RESTORED) (46:09) [iplay gif] so keep the top down on your convertible if you re out there driving around so we can see what you re doing [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Bill Deane] Not only has the music been restored on this rare aircheck of Bill Deane and 1961 WFUN the aircheck itself has been re constructed to feature a few classic PAMS jingles and lots of original WFUN production from 1961 Missing jingles were replaced with comparable jingles from the same series missing newscasts were replaced with news promos and missing commercial and promotional content was replaced with selections from Bill Deane s contributed archive of commercials and promos Bud Connell (WNOE WABC) consulted WFUN at this time and the gag commercials offering The Goodyear Blimp (for only $400 000) and The Fountainbleu Hotel (for only $65 000 000) were part of the creative energy that Connell brought to The Fun Spot There s even a spoof for one of the wonders of the world in adult or teenage size but nary a clue as to what it actually is!

A jingle that was all about Eastman I had heard a promo song from TM Productions called At TM We Listen to You and thought it could be rewritten and become a production singing the virtues of Eastman Radio I called my old friend at TM Jerry Atchley and he said Sure come on down to Dallas and we ll re sing it for your rep firm I negotiated what I thought was a reasonable price for the jingle $500 Little did Jerry and TM honcho Jim Long realize how difficult this project would become You see I wanted every call letter from the Eastman station list to be sung in those stations actual musical logos It was several hundred stations and that many different musical signatures I went to Dallas and was assigned to the late Bob Piper a lawyer turned musician He was a gentle and patient producer It must have taken over six hours of TM studio time to complete this jingle You don t sing this long a jingle in one take It was done in many pieces and then mixed together Frank Boyle and Gary Edens Eastman Radio Chairman Frank Boyle with Gary Edens at a 1979 Phoenix retreat for the firm The ice carving SBC stood for Southern Broadcasting Company Eastman was the exclusive national rep firm for Southern After this five and a half minute jingle was completed the next morning I was at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at the New York Eastman headquarters premiering this production for their sales staff and rep brass Carl Butrum Jerry Schubert Bill Burton and Frank Boyle I think they all liked it They gave me a standing ovation They should have given the ovation to TM for surely Jim Long and Jerry Atchley lost money on this $500 deal In addition to the then Eastman station list being featured in the jingle there was some intended inside humor in the production Some aimed at spoofing Eastman President Tiger Bill Burton who was fond of taking doughnuts to time buyers on sales calls and telling everybody to Be Fabulous The jingle became known as the Eastman Anthem because of the church choir like acapella style used at the ending Eastman Radio in its independent life was known as a scrappy sales firm representing many of the nation s leading Top 40 stations Today as part of Clear Channel Communications Eastman is consistently one of the top three billing national rep firms in the USA And still the only rep firm I know of with its own jingle [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 1Kbps (20Khz) [play gif] WKIX Raleigh N C Reunion on WTRG FM May 1 1993 (52:48) (includes all four parts below) Does anybody remember these guys?

Before long I was off to Georgia for a two year stint at Oxford College a division of and original campus of Emory University My junior year and part of the senior year were spent at the main campus in Atlanta It was during these first three years of college that the Webcor was put to fair use recording from the radio After 1965 the recorder and tapes went into storage at my Mom s house in North Carolina During the next 13 years I lived in Jackson Mississippi (where I obtained a B A degree from Millsaps College in 1969) Atlanta (twice) Dallas and Washington DC I have been back in Atlanta now since 1978  sure feels like home to me The story of finding old tapes in closets basements and attics is certainly not unique That s exactly what happened here I had all but forgotten about these tapes until the day I happened upon Uncle Ricky s Repository I thought I remembered that my tapes had disappeared at some point years before in a family move However I searched through my Mom s more recent attic in August (1998) and BINGO there they were in a footlocker which I had used during earlier college days (The Webcor however was not to be found ) I hope you will enjoy these exhibits They are very crude  a lot of editing was done at the time of original recording Most of these exhibits have been pieced together from non contiguous segments Snippets or not I think you will relish these bits of Top 40 radio in its high riding days I work from Atlanta as a self employed manufacturers rep and have run my own business since 1986 selling finer stationery products to specialty retail stores I would especially like to thank the following people who have helped point the way toward this new interest in my life: Uncle Ricky himself for having the most fantastic website in the world (and for me the most appreciated) to Tom Konard of the Aircheck Factory who has been a very important resource in my collecting endeavors to Russell Wells a radioman in Troy Alabama who has the most fantastic collection of Southern airchecks anywhere and to Don Keith in Birmingham Alabama a great novel writer and a great dj Without you guys my tapes might still be in the attic Steve Farrington maintained A CELEBRATION and REMEMBRANCE of BYGONE SOUTHERN RADIO and RETRO DIXIE CULTURE at www wakeatlanta com The Repository thanks Steve Farrington for sharing!

Though this recording is very tightly scoped (sometimes choppy pay attention!) the fidelity is remarkable considering that on the debut date of September 7 2008 it was made 48 years ago!

This aircheck is presented in The Steve Farrington Collection by Paul Allen It is one of many classic Atlanta recordings made by Paul in the early 60 s Paul Allen passed away after a sixteen year battle with multiple sclerosis on December 5 2011 By April 1963 Bartell had sold WAKE to Basic Communications The new owners left things pretty much as they had been (at least for a while ) The playlist included the usual heavy dose of R&B which had always been a big part of the southern hit parade Time tones news bugs reverb on demand various promos and public service announcements are all included It Happened at the World s Fair and How the West was Won were the big movies on this Easter weekend While Bob Boo Boo Baker was quipping and tripping his way through this Saturday afternoon megashift (Noon to 6) the local Top 40 radio wars were underway in earnest WAKE was still a showcase of talent and WPLO had put together its own impressive air staff In fact Baker moved to WPLO in 1964 But it wouldn t be long until both stations pulled the plug on Top 40 WAKE left the format in 1964 WPLO in 1965 and WQXI had nothing but smooth sailing ahead [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2 5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 20 7Kbs (10Khz) [play gif] Ernie Phillips WAKE Atlanta August 31 1963 (44:44) This hootenanny music is going to present a problem I believe [Description by Uncle Ricky] This aircheck is presented in The Steve Farrington Collection by Paul Allen (d December 5 2011) This is another of many classic Atlanta recordings made by Paul in the early 60 s It is another of many classic Atlanta recordings made by Paul in the early 60 s Ernie Phillips is featured from Atlanta Georgia in the first hour of the WAKE overnight show from Saturday August 31 1963 The music on this mostly unscoped recording is of particular interest It s a Hootenanny weekend and every other song is a Hootenanny song The American Heritage Dictionary defines hootenanny as An informal performance by folk singers typically with participation by the audience For the most part that s what gets played here What is truly surprising is that a respectable number of these songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100! I suppose it s reasonable to say that American Folk Music enjoyed a peak in popularity in the early 60 s Depending on your age and cultural roots you may find a number of these tunes familiar As for Mr Phillips his performance is typical of smaller market overnight guys in the early 60 s: Casual self deprecating and sometimes honestly confused!

town WPLJ had slowly segued from AOR to CHR over the latter months of 1983 with Larry Berger staying on as PD A year later Hit Radio 95 is starting to get its act together But the station would not see its best ratings for another year after it had been rechristened Power 95 Since its August 1983 sign on Z 100 s Scott Shannon had constantly attacked WPLJ on the air often making fun of Larry Berger WPLJ remained quiet until late in 1984 when its frustrations exploded with a parody of Z 100 s imaging Z 100 threatened a lawsuit and WPLJ stopped airing the piece But on this aircheck WPLJ refers to Z 100 as Zit 100 Fast Jimi Roberts was a natural and always one of my favorites I believe he came to WPLJ straight from a small FM in Toms River New Jersey He was excellent on WPLJ from his

Official Hound Dogger An original Hound Dog Kingdom membership card from WTMA Charleston circa 1956 I started The Hound Dog Kingdom in 1956 at WTMA in Charleston S C I remembered the success Alan Freed had in Cleveland with his Moon Dog Show The Hound Dog was patterned after the Freed show but it was not a copy Nobody was playing what was called race music except Freed I collected all the R&B records by Fats Domino Laverne Baker etc  and that s what I played keeping the backbeat by slapping a ruler against the console and yelling along with the singers throughout the records I played a rhythm beat on a tape loop between records so there was no dead air The key was the delivery I used a gruff yet frantic gravel voice and rhymed almost everything I said The Hound Dog was a howling wolf sound effect Charleston South Carolina July 5 1956 Hound Dog Scrap Jack Gale is seeking an Injuction against Bill Haley s Two Hound Dogs I opened The Hound Dog Record Shop and bought several thousand used records from juke box operators all Hound Dog music and put them on sale 5 for a dollar We sold out in a matter of days The show was such a success in Charleston that when I got to WITH in Baltimore in 1957 I talked Sales Manager Jake Embry into letting me put it on the air on Saturday nights It caught on immediately and became a regular feature At drive ins around Baltimore every car radio would be blaring with the squealing sounds of the dog Leon Golnick of the Golnick agency sold it to the Madera Bonded Wine and Liquor Company and they came up with special product

would tape every day after the morning show at WITH until we had about forty hours of tape that we just kept rotating After each taping I would come out of the studio exhausted with about twelve broken rulers but it was a ball I loved that show and savored every minute of it At the reunion in Baltimore in 1996 people approached me with their original Hound Dog cards from the 50 s and wanted

A good friend of mine had a neighbor who was an engineer for a local radio station and had a transmitter 2 turntables microphones etc and he put us on the air The station was called WMFH (for MayField Hts our hometown a Cleveland suburb) and we were actually on the air at 540 kc for about 6 months! That spawned my interest in radio and music and it is still with me today I majored in Radio and TV at Ohio State University and at one time was working 3 part time non paying radio jobs at OSU! Although I ve never worked in commercial radio or TV I ve always enjoyed listening to the great stations and jocks of the 1960s and 70s I got out of radio in 1976 when I got my first Betamax VCR and became a video fanatic (see my Betamax website at www betainfoguide com) but even by then I had built up an extensive radio and music collection that spans 1960 thru 1976 Some of the many airchecks that I have are on this site Many were made on my trusty Webcor Royalite mono tape recorder which I retired in 1973 when I got a Teac 3300 stereo deck Being from Cleveland I was fortunate to have some of the classic stations in my area KYW/WKYC WHK WIXY and of course my favorite CKLW I can t believe there isn t more of WIXY on the Web although it lasted only 10 years it had some GREAT jocks played the best music had great jingles and was a major force in Cleveland radio in its heyday I also lived in Maryland in 1973 and made some airchecks of some really good stations at that time WPGC WMOD WCAO WWDC WASH and others I remember tracking 38 FM stereo stations on the dial when I lived there not bad for the early 70 s!

This check even has some complete newscasts some with Bob Ingle reporting who has done Cleveland news since forever!

At approximately 10 minutes into this check is a Hitbound song that is not announced it took me 30 years to find out what it is ( Lay Down by The Strawbs) Plus there is a rather long but nicely sung WTUE promo around 23:20 something you d never hear today!

John Lennon (Monday December 8 1980) my station (at that time WZXR Memphis) aired a memorial tribute It aired on the weekend after the tragedy and included a ten minute period of silence followed by this piece It is a montage of all The Beatles songs edited from A to Z The version here has been updated to include material from the Anthology series Ironically I was working on the piece even before the Lennon tragedy I was moved to complete it in time for the tribute My inspiration dates back to the WLS Time Capsule pieces which aired every New Year s at midnight The concept of doing a montage stuck with me and I have applied it to a number of situations This exhibit first appeared at REELRADIO on December 3 2000 In 2006 I created a new digital remix (Version #9) with all music sourced from

(The jock pushed a button to kick it into LOUD Was this a Miami Vice?) Also interesting that both Miami stations had that SPECIAL reverb It must have been a combination of tape loop and chamber (chamber chamber) [Update 2003: Since writing this description in 1996 I have learned that the Storz stations used an oil dampened reverb designed for a Hammond Organ it created a delay with a tape type slapback effect ] You ll actually hear a jingle for the real time 12:23 in Miami (How many of these did they have I wonder?)

Some legends are born And some are born legends Joey Reynolds is both While still in his teens he began a radio career that everyone knew would take him far And it did all across the Eastern Seaboard on his 50K hometown monster WKBW AM 1520 in Buffalo N Y Some of his bits from those days are legendary including calling Long Distance information asking for Memphis and then proceeding to lead a confused operator through the words to the entire Johnny Rivers song (OPERATOR: Sir if you could just tell me where she lives REYNOLDS: Her home is on the south side high above a ridge just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge ) It was this kind of inspired lunacy that made all Buffalo listen when Reynolds was invited home to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of WGRQ FM in Christmas of 1973 And he didn t disappoint proceeding to tear the format to shreds and ad lib like crazy on the air for 3 hours This is the last 30 minutes of the show and if anything it shows he was just getting revved up!

The station WMMT McMinnville TN was a Mutual affiliate and the only station in town at the time However he recalls its having had several excellent announcers including Chris Lane (Country DJ Hall of Fame) who thanks to Eddie Arnold began his long and very successful commercial career in this small town Without intervening contact for 15 years Sam would later work with Chris when he returned to Bartell in Milwaukee before Chris went to KYA He and the terrific Terrell Metheny (Mitch Michael) were also reunited at WOKY They had first worked together at WKDA A second station (WBMC) went on the air May 1 1955 and Sammy became a member of the original announcing staff He managed a full time radio shift while not allowing his grades to suffer and graduated Valedictorian of his class During this year he shared an apartment with a fellow announcer Ed Philllips who later would be known as Mel Kent (WYDE) Johnny Holiday (KCBQ) Johnny Mitchell (KHJ) and Sebastian Stone (KFRC and WOR FM) Years later Ed would phone Sam (WKDA) when Bartell was transferring him from WYDE to KCBQ and suggest he take the spot he was leaving in Birmingham That was Sam s introduction to Bartell It also resulted in his meeting his wife of 53 years! At WYDE he was privileged to work with Jay Cook (WFIL Gannett President) and Jim Staggs (WCFL WMAQ) and others His and Birmingham s favorite Joe Carl died of lung cancer in this brief window of time Joe was only 21! Following discharge from the Army where he served as a Broadcast Specialist Sam resumed his radio career at WYDE WADO WJJD WDGY WOKY and WQXI Air shifts were generally only three to four hours a day then an hour or so of production work This permitted him to pursue his newly developed interest in the study of the stock market He left broadcasting for those greater financial prospects in 1966 After a successful career as a Chartered Market Technician and affiliate of the New York Society of Security Analysts Sam retired in 2003 In the intervening years he has continued to do limited voice over and commercial work Now he is having thoughts of doing radio again just for the fun of it!

Jack left WSM and took the helm of WKDA and turned it into a phenomenal success He also expanded his publishing interests and hired Buddy Killen a staff bull fiddle player on the Opry to manage his catalog With the hits of Roger Miller and scores of others Tree Publishing became the publisher of the year time after time after time Tree Publishing became Sony Tree when Buddy long after Jack s death sold it to Sony Jack was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame by Chet Atkins John Kluge (yes THE John Kluge  Metromedia) bought WKDA while I was there and called a staff meeting While I was impressed with him and his extremely likeable manner I had no idea I was sitting at the feet of a man who would become one of the richest in the world Hairl and Sam Hairl Hensley and Sam Hale backstage at The Grand Ole Opry Hairl is dean of WSM and Opry announcers Hairl is heard on the WKDA snippets with Terrell Metheny ( Wheel For A Day ) and doing the Amoco spots in the news Aside from me the voice that is heard most often on this tape is Hairl Hensley He was doing the all night show at the time He later switched to country and has become the dean of announcers at WSM and The Grand Ole Opry still going strong The two voice promotion is Hairl and Terrell L Metheny Jr At the time his air name was Ronn Terrell He later used the name Mitch Michael and recently retired after programming and then managing radio stations for several years His son Kevin has also developed an outstanding career in broadcasting At the end of a jock s air shift the jock would be responsible for the newscast preceding the next jock s record show In this case I m completing my shift by doing the news preceding Ronn s show Ronn had been responsible for the newscast during my show We worked back then!

This time at a truly great radio station NewsRadio 620 KTAR Phoenix where I did weekend afternoons and fill ins from 2000 2004 In 2002 I was involved in the launch of a new independent television station in Phoenix as the producer and host of a weekly half hour program about my second love  cars In October 2003 they made me Director of Programming and Promotion After two years of seven day weeks and new responsibilities added to that something had to give  namely a regular radio show In August 2008 I left and launched my own online venture about cars: TireKicker blogspot com And from January 2009 until May 2011 I was the morning traffic anchor and reporter for ABC15 in Phoenix  taking me full circle Remember my first radio idol was KMPC s Captain Max Schumacher In 2012 I returned to radio doing traffic reports for Total Traffic Network in Phoenix Tucson Las Vegas Albuquerque El Paso and Salt Lake City In 2013 I transferred to TTN s 24/7 News service as a writer on the National Desk and two weeks later was promoted to news anchor for 24 markets (including New York Chicago Philadelphia and Washington D C ) on Clear Channel s iHeartRadio app All three of those jobs (traffic National Desk and iHeartRadio) were in the same big newsroom at Clear Channel s Phoenix hub In November of 2013 I returned home to California 36 years to the day I left  continuing to anchor for iHeartRadio in the same markets and adding overnight weekend newscasts for KOMO Seattle from the studios of KFBK Sacramento In February of 2014 I was asked to make another move (in the same building) and become Editor of The KFBK Morning News A few months later I became Assistant News Director and then Managing Editor In October of 2016 I received the biggest honor of a 45 year and counting career I joined The Afternoon News with Kitty O Neill as co anchor and was promoted to News Director of KFBK KFBK is a heritage radio station with a monster 50 000 watt signal at 1530 AM pumped through the only true Franklin antenna system in the United States  giving us the highest field strength of any U S station and a groundwave that makes us resistant to skywave fade (I used to listen on the drive home from Clear Channel Phoenix on fall and winter nights  a distance of more than 700 miles) It has been serving Northern California (and most of Western America) since 1922 We re also on FM at 93 1 and on the iHeartRadio app for long distance listening I am just as proud of my association with REELRADIO and I tell anyone who ll listen just what Uncle Ricky and dozens of Reelpals have built the finest museum of 20th century pop music radio imaginable [rmenu gif] [Descriptions by Michael Hagerty] G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32Kbps (10Khz) [play gif] Dan Ingram WABC New York 1965 Power Blackout (06:59) Up a Lazy River in the key of R The Great Northeast Power Blackout of 1965 started as a brownout as Dan Ingram demonstrates in this brief sample of WABC before the plug was pulled Listen as America s most powerful Top 40 station loses power and Ingram true to form has fun with it [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository [g250 gif] TOP STREAM 20 7Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] Paul Miller KOMA Oklahoma City July 23 1965 (14:41) I d tell you another one like that but I d set off the sprinkler system Never heard of Paul Miller?

As a high school freshman in 1956 I was given an old Broadcasting yearbook by an engineer at WMAP my hometown station in Monroe NC It became my bible Subsequently while on vacation in South Florida I discovered that the radio stations there sounded radically different from those in Carolina By the time I graduated I had developed an affinity for the larger than life sounds of WQAM WFUN WNOE WTIX WQXI & etc Upon going fulltime in radio in 1961 I embarked upon a 40 year odyssey from announcer to owner and everything in between Most of my stops were great a few were not I always tried to never move unless I felt I was going to learn something new  occasionally the lesson was painful Many times over the years though I was fortunate enough to put together a station that had such special magic you could actually taste it I had the good luck to get to know and work with some great talent I miss them all  the people & the stations In thinking about radio in general two quotes come to mind both from longtime engineer friends: From Don Jones on the way radio used to be: When I see somebody in radio that I haven t seen in a while he s always got a new wife and a worse car! From Dave Hultsman on today s radio: One of these days that fancy hard drive is going to be hit by lightning and when the guy can t fix it he s going to sit down at the board and open the mic and say Well that was a heck of a storm huh  but it looks like it s over I reckon it will be a while before we get back to normal with our programming system In the meantime here s a song from this CD over here In a few minutes the phone rings and a listener says Hey I kinda like this say could you play In 2000 at 59 and disappointed in where I saw radio going I sold my last station & tried to retire In 2001 I started a shopper type newspaper which covered eight middle Georgia counties In January of 2003 I also started brokering radio stations with Ted Gray out of NC We have a website called Broadcaststations4sale com focusing primarily on stations in the Southeast It does my heart good when I see that gleam in the eye of a prospective new owner! As of 2005 I also have an ownership interest in and manage a station in Gadsden AL In addition to my current two careers I maintain a huge radio repository of my own with thousands of tapes and files from 1960 to 2000 and a large collection of antique radios In recent years I have collected a cabinet full of radio memorabilia from Ebay (It has all been willed to Uncle Ricky!)

Easy Listening) a summer stint at WKLG Rock Harbor (Easy 102 Key Largo) then WXDJ (95 7 The Breeze Miami Contemporary Jazz) my last Miami station I had had enough Prior to that 2 years of television for Palmer Cablevision in Naples Florida (NewsWatch 9) as a Weatherman and Feature Reporter There I had my first experience at world wide exposure after sending a feature story on the Swamp Buggy Races to CNN (it was used as the kicker story on Headline News for 2 days in a row every other half hour!) Before Florida my first TV job was in 1982 at WTVE Reading (TV51 NewsBeat) That newscast went belly up after 6 months but for being paid 2 hours a day minimum wage and the rest of my income supplemented by the CETA program for migrant workers (ironic!) I at least had tape! Every job before that was radio starting at WYCR FM (98YCR York Hanover Pennsylvania) while still in High School in 1976 During college at Temple University in Philadelphia I worked for WTTM Trenton WSSJ Camden and WQIQ Chester/Aston After college finally my first full time radio gig at WLAN FM in Lancaster Pennsylvania doing overnights Then I was hired away by WFEC/Harrisburg to work a new format called Hot Hits! Having grown up listening to stations like WFIL and WABC this was a chance to do some high energy Top 40 radio I couldn t pass it up even though I was still under contract at WLAN That s why my air name was changed to Robert Walker while I was at WFEC So when people say it must be great being in broadcasting I smile back on the experiences and wouldn t trade them for the world Although I crave the stability of television and thoroughly enjoy working for the number one station in Southern New England there s still a place in my heart for radio Enjoy the collection!

Grand Kook! Ten Ten WINS! Grand Kook! Grand Kook! Ten Ten WINS! These Murray Kaufman Show themes aired on WINS Here they re taken from a promotional 45 [mksubway jpg] As the overnight host of the Swingin Soiree Murray built a following that readily tuned in earlier when Murray assumed Alan Freed s primetime slot following Freed s untimely fall during the payola scandals From mid 1958 until the sale of WINS to Group W and its conversion to an all news format in 1965 Murray the K was the king of the New York City airwaves PLAY Murray the K Theme WINS (02:28) [ra30 gif] This meeting of the Swingin Soiree is now in session This Blast from the Past features a later rendition of Murray s theme By this time he was no longer Murray Kaufman He was Murray the K PLAY Murray the K Doe (01:21) [ra30 gif] It didn t seem human and if it were what kind of being would make THAT sound? Always the showman Kaufman frequently wrote and produced stories around the music he played This example (date unknown) demonstrates Murray s love for a good yarn Murray s antics on the air on the streets in the subways and overhead (broadcasting from Air Force jets) combined with his natural showmanship to earn him a virtual franchise in live events [mkfox65 jpg] As the host of personal appearances by hot bands at local movie theatres or as the emcee of four times a year rock n roll shows at the Brooklyn Fox Theatre Murray developed the first truly multi racial audience Like Freed before him Murray Kaufman believed in the talents of black and Latin artists and preferred to play their records rather than the cover versions recorded by white singers By building preference for a wide variety of music on the air (including Frank Sinatra whose music opened every show) Murray attracted fans from every strata to his live shows and in their passion for the music tensions had virtually no opportunity to develop Kaufman went live in other ways He became the unofficial American spokesman for The Beatles thanks to touring American groups who were the opening acts at Beatle concerts in Great Britain (before the group arrived in America) When Brian Epstein asked for advice those performers advised Brian Epstein to get in Kaufman s good graces if he wanted the Beatles to succeed in the States New York was the market they had to own and Kaufman owned New York in the ratings [mkbeatls jpg] PLAY Murray the K and the Beatles Miami 1964 (04:46) [ra30 gif] Oh well Murray babe we re gonna miss you too In Miami Murray recorded programs with the Beatles for WINS This is raw pre broadcast tape that includes whispered instructions from his engineer Of course once the Beatles arrived Murray and the group were inseparable He broadcast from their hotel room accompanied them to their first show in Washington DC co hosted their second show at Carnegie Hall and went with them to Miami for the third leg before joining them in England and emceeing a Wembley Stadium concert at which he also met the Rolling Stones suggesting that they cover an American R&B hit which became their first number one hit in America PLAY Murray the K at Wembley Stadium 1964 (1:22) [ra30 gif] Right about now I would like to bring on somebody for ya Kaufman introduces the Beatles at the Wembley Stadium NME show accompanied by the screams of thousands of young fans It was that popularity that led the Federal government s Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to approach Murray about producing a national program that would a) appeal to inner city youngsters and b) let them know about job opportunities through the New Chance program The show It s What s Happenin Baby which was arguably the first music video attracted national headlines the censure of Congressmen who deplored the use of public funds to broadcast jungle music and too many inquiries from young people about a government program that turned out to be woefully underfunded Locally Kaufman was innovative in other ways He devised a new dance hall phenomenon that set the pattern for Manhattan s Cheetah and San Francisco s Fillmore Auditorium In an abandoned airplane hangar at Long Island s Roosevelt Field the starting point of Lindbergh s historic flight he created Murray the K s World a multi level multi media discotheque that combined live and recorded music with projected slides and film providing a level of sensory overload that only Timothy Leary seemed able to exceed with the help of mind altering drugs [mkstdo63 jpg] As the World was taking off (and quickly crashing) WINS was changing formats There was no more room for Murray the K and his cronies Times were changing The first threat was Top 40 a format which was considered before Group W s decision to convert WINS to all news all the time For someone like Murray Top 40 was oxygen debt cutting off the creative freedom to program his own show choose his own music take his own risks like the time he refused to play the A side of Dionne Warwick s new record because he was convinced that the B side would prove to be the hit In spite of calls from everyone connected with Sceptre Records Dionne s label Murray played the B side Walk On By Within a year Murray was leading a group of disillusioned talent to a new frontier FM rock On WOR FM Murray set the tone for the rest of the 60s He played records from albums not singles so that Bob Dylan s Positively Fourth Street and Janis Ian s Society s Child were aired in full (one of the few places they could get played at all initially) At the same time Kaufman was extending his OEO experience to produce local television specials that were combinations of on location and in concert performances punctuated by unexpected appearances by guests such as football great Joe Namath and the undisputed king of variety shows Ed Sullivan Less than twelve months later when Bill Drake came in to program WOR as an oldies format station Murray and the others quickly left Not however before Murray told his listeners as he had at WINS just exactly what the executives were planning to do before the executives had alerted the press It won him few friends in a town where everyone in the industry knows everyone in the industry and where disloyalty is as ominous as a Mafia kiss Thanks to WINS nightly 50 000 watt clear channeling Murray s reputation reached far beyond the boundaries of metro New York For awhile he aired in Toronto then in Washington and Maryland before returning in the early 1970s to a national stint on NBC Monitor and subsequently to a regular program on WNBC PLAY Murray the K and the story of Noah WNBC (2:30) [ra30 gif] That s a story that may

But his love of music and the record collection he had started at a young age led to a greater interest in radio  in particular the Top 40 stations And the fact that his father (whose aircheck is heard in this collection) worked in Top 40 radio also added to Brian s interest To top it all off it became a family affair Brian s brother Rodger Jr worked part time at WMOH running various syndicated and public service programs as well as the occasional opportunity to crack the mic Having grown up around radio whether it be the programming or the business side it was only natural that Brian got into the business While in high school he would occasionally do some board opping when needed at KNCN FM in Corpus Christi Texas while in college he got the opportunity to do weekends/swing at KBFM in McAllen/Brownsville Texas leading to a full time shift doing 10pm 2am there In October 1992 Brian returned to his native Cincinnati working various odd jobs while doing weekends at WKRQ FM until March of 1995 when he came home to be a part of the staff of Hamilton Ohio s WMOH where he is today The airchecks featured are from Brian Kay s personal collection ENJOY!

In the formative years of the late 1970 s early 1980 s my afternoons and evenings were filled with Ron Lundy Dan Ingram and George Michael On Sunday nights I would hide under my covers and listen to Musicradio77 on my portable radio until Howard Cossell came on at 10 p m I didn t know it then but I was listening to the heart and soul of Top 40 radio And then suddenly it ended All those personalities and music I learned to love gone And just as I was growing old enough to appreciate WABC and it s place in radio history For what seemed like forever I remained in a radio limbo: going from station to station trying to find the magic that I lost The magic returned during my freshman year in high school 1983 Easy listening WVNJ went off the air to be replaced by WHTZ Z100 Back then it was my generation s equivalent to the glory days of WABC Scott Shannon J R Nelson Anita Bonita Janet From Another Planet Shadoe Stevens Jack the Wack and Hollywood Hamifton those are the personalities I remember from the Flamethrower They brought the fun and the competition back into New York Radio Top 40 was back! So as I said how could I not be influenced to go into radio? I spent 3 of the best years of my life (before I got married of course) at Rutgers University s WRSU FM as in the news and community affairs departments In my last year at college I held down reporting duties at 1450 WCTC AM in New Brunswick New Jersey honing my skills for a future career in radio Unfortunately lack of opportunities and money prevented me from breaking into the big time and I ended up in a career working with computers (Hey who doesn t these days?) I m still active in my college radio station attending yearly on air Alumni Reunions and someday I II return to the industry on a more full time basis In the end I hope to be part of the next great generation in radio The Repository thanks Rich Keller for sharing!

I did pretty well at it getting straight A s and a place on the Dean s List so I figured that I d found my calling Back in those days I collected a bunch of aircheck tapes from my then favorite stations I studied the techniques for school but I just liked listening to them too Eventually I connected with others who had done the same and we traded While I was still in school I took a job doing the news part time at KBLA in Burbank CA That was in 1965 It worked into a job offer from KWIZ AM/FM Santa Ana which so far as I know was the first all oldie station anywhere That ended in 1969 and I returned to the station in Burbank which was now KBBQ (Country) I HATED the Country format but by then I had a wife and son and I needed the job (didn t have to turn the monitor up though!) The P D from KLAC Los Angeles heard me on the air and offered me a job at his station Needless to say I took it After several months I switched over to the Engineering Department there The station was co housed with KMET FM and I did Production Engineering for both In 1970 I moved over to KFWB Los Angeles as a Production Engineer A couple of years later I briefly moved to KNX/CBS but didn t much care for it and returned to KFWB where I stayed until 1979 That s when I moved over to television where I did freelance audio work (common in that business) for a short time That led to a staff offer from KTLA TV in 1980 I started there doing doofus work but moved up the ladder to the position of Senior Engineer and later Crew Chief Don Kent at CBS Central Control 1972 Don Kent on the Pacific Network Switcher in CBS Central Control on the first floor of the CBS Radio building in Hollywood This is the switcher that controlled all the network traffic during the heyday of live radio It was still in use in the 70 s The CBS Network was reversible that is programming could originate from any O&O station on the network Since moving to television my aircheck interests switched to restoration of early videotape recordings I did all the restorations for the UCLA Film and Television Archive between about 1987 and 2002 In 1988 I won a Primetime Emmy for restoring the earliest television show recorded on color tape An Evening With Fred Astaire (1958) Since then I have done several others including The Nixon Krushchev Kitchen Debate for the Library of Congress I m real proud of how those early shows turned out Many years ago I collected rock n roll records but the sound changed from what I liked and I hung that up I still have about three thousand records from back then though In the intervening years since college I just put those old aircheck tapes on a shelf in the garage I haven t listened to them since the early 70 s but they still sound pretty good so enjoy!

The Tom Kent Collection It all started on a two watt pirate radio station in his bedroom in Winston Salem North Carolina at the ripe young age of 13 Young Tom Kent would put long songs on and get on his bicycle and ride around the neighborhood knocking on doors asking his neighbors to listen Soon after he would have his own weekend radio show on local station WAIR All through North Forsyth High School young Tom would work overnights and go to school all day! That s how much he craved that precious airtime and he was an excellent if somewhat zombified student Upon graduation Tom took his radio career on the road At the ripe young age of 18 he hosted the night show at WHBQ in Memphis He was hired by Memphis Mafioso George Klein who was also Elvis Presley s best friend GK as he was affectionately known was the person who helped create the Truckin Tom Cookin Kent persona Thus Truckin Tom was born He was one of the most outrageous radio personalities in the history of top 40 radio As legend has it one night in 1974 while on the air in Memphis George Klein would be at Graceland visiting his friend The King  and listening to Kent Elvis was so impressed he would ask George to set up a meeting Elvis wanted to meet this crazy person he had been listening to on the radio but not at Graceland A complete stranger would never be invited to Graceland for the first meeting So Elvis would rent out the Memphian movie theater in downtown Memphis and show old movies all night long The meeting was set Just prior to that day a huge radio station in Cleveland Ohio would come calling and court the young Kent to WIXY 1260 Kent promptly dissed the King and took the job in Cleveland  thus never meeting Rock and Roll s greatest idol Over the next several years Tom Kent would enjoy success on the air at legendary stations like WIXY KLIF/ DALLAS WIBG/PHILADELPHIA WMJX/MIAMI WGCL/CLEVELAND WLS/CHICAGO and WAVA/WASHINGTON Nominated for many awards including Billboard Major Market Air Personality of the Year Tom would become legendary in the ranks of radio greats Today Tom lives just outside of Cleveland Ohio with his wife Karen and hosted the fastest growing syndicated radio show in America called Hall of Fame Coast to Coast in addition to Into the 70s  all were heard seven nights a week on over 150 radio stations across the USA His broadcasts originated live every night from his basement in his home Some say he s come full circle  back to his very early teen years when he would also broadcast from his home Only this time his neighborhood was the world!

Pete McNeal KYA San Francisco June 6 1970 (6:46) Soft drinks taste great in a bottle This aircheck begins with true Top 40 promise but quickly drifts into oblivion Despite the genuine PAMS jingles KYA a pioneering San Francisco Top 40 had real trouble projecting a desirable brand name just ten years after their initial success as a Bay Area Top 40 This (scoped) half hour creates the impression that all the genius of their initial direction had been lost Yes we have hot PAMS jingles but we don t play them often Yes we play Top 40 but even though it is 1970 we never play two records back to back Sometimes we identify the station when we play a record and we play everything from the Marvelettes to Leon Russell ( Future Heavies ) and we play Preparation H spots directly into Hitchin A Ride It s not necessarily the music or content or the talent that is disappointing it s the presentation There is no sense of station The GOOD news (I think) is that Pete McNeal went on to KHJ from 1970 to 1972 so he survived this uncomfortable experience in the Mysterious World of KYA [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository [ra30 gif] [play gif] Larry Lujack and Lyle Dean WLS 10/70 (15:54) Last Call

First nobody does Lujack like Lujack Plus we get almost an entire newscast from legendary supervoice Lyle Dean Orson Welles sells square donuts for the Wings of Man We learn that computers are the thing of the future And analytical listeners will note the nearly Adult Contemporary music selection in this half hour proving again that classic big signal AM Top 40 was as much an adult format as a

Not normally KCBQ had used reverb throughout the 60 s as a traditional top 40 station but somewhere in the late 60 s or very early 70 s reverb on the chain was taken out However for some reason Rich Brother Robin the PD in 1974 reactivated the reverb on the Q for one day and here it is featured on the Shotgun Tom Kelly show As you listen it s obvious that Shotgun grew up listening to jocks in the 60 s using the reverb on demand button on the board Tom has fun with that button too especially coming out of the newscast with Boyd R Britton Enjoy Reverb Day on the Q!

My curiosity finally got the best of me and I decided to do some digging in the form of a class project when I was a junior in high school It was this thirst for knowledge that not only earned me an A plus but lead me to a career in L A radio with KSBR KABC and KRTH Los Angeles where I work today as a board op and production assistant My quest first took me eastward to Pittsburgh and the country s first radio station station KDKA But wait a minute that s four calls not three! Okay I ll make an exception after all it was the first or was it? Lee DeForrest Lee DeForrest According to most researchers Dr Lee DeForrest was the first to broadcast a regular series of voice transmissions from an experimental station in New York as early as 1907 Then there was Charles Herrold of San Jose who put FN on the air in the spring of 1909 By 1912 13 he was identifing the signal as SJN then 6XF in 1916 The station which was granted a commercial broadcast license as KQW in 1921 eventually became KCBS San Francisco Still others believe WWJ Detroit was first when it began a regularly scheduled broadcast of programing in the summer of 1920 as 8MK KNX Los Angeles also went on the air about the same time as 6ADZ But without question it was KDKA Pittsburgh that applied for and was granted the very first commercial broadcast license by the Commerce Department on October 27th 1920 Needless to say this collection focuses on some these early pioneers as they sounded in the 1950 s 60 s and 70 s The Repository thanks Mike Lynch for sharing!

He was first granted the call letters 6ADZ later changed to KGC and finally to KNX Christian began broadcasting on September 10 1920 by playing recorded music borrowed from music stores and technically becoming L A s first disc jockey Bob Crane Studio KNX 1950 s Bob Crane s KNX Studio circa 1950 s By the Summer of 1922 about 22 other stations in and around the Los Angeles area were broadcasting on a shared single wave length of 360 meters but KNX was one of the only three stations to gain success and go onto a long history of continuous operation In 1929 KNX increased power to 5 000 watts then 10 000 in 1932 25 000 watts in 1933 and finally 50 000 watts in 1934 In 1938 KNX moved into the new KNX/CBS Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood which became famous as Columbia Square It was here that the great CBS Radio stars such as Eddie Cantor Al Jolson Jack Benny Bob Crane Composite A composite photo of Bob Cranes autographed To Jim the best engineer since our Saturday show began Thanks so much Bob Crane Gene Autry Steve Allen Edgar Bergen Bing Crosby Orson Welles Red Skelton Jackie Gleason George Burns and Gracie Allen made history broadcasting their shows in front of a live audience In the 1940 s and 50 s KNX served as a moderately successful music and personality station featuring CBS network shows hosted by Art Linkletter and Arthur Godfrey But it wasn t until Bob Crane arrived at KNX to do mornings that KNX radio became a dominant force in the L A market Other notable talents included Bill Ballance Rege Cordic Jim Hawthorne and Michael Jackson Bob

air as 8ZAE on November 19 1919 In January 1921 a legend was born when 8ZAE changed it s call letters to KQV King of the Quaker Valley Originally KQV began broadcasting on 833 Khz on the AM radio dial then moved to 1090 in 1925 1110 in 1927 1380 in 1931 and finally 1410 Khz in March 29 1941 By 1944 the station was serving as a full service outlet which became known as a Live and Lively format and included music news and various programs from the NBC blue network On Thursday August 29 1957 the American Broadcasting Company paid $700 000 for the station and after only five months on January 1 1958 KQV switched from its Live and Lively format to top forty which lasted for almost two decades KQV s original top 40 line up included Chuck Dougherty at 6 am Don McNeill s Breakfast Club at 9 Herb Oscar Anderson at 10 Henry DaBecco at 11 Jim Reeves at 1 pm Jim Backus at 2 pm Sam Holman at 3 pm Merv Griffin at 7:15 pm and Dave Scott 9p to midnight The ABC parade of stars was cleverly integrated into KQV s local programing According to KQV historian Jeff Roteman It was an exciting time for radio as the stations did battle KDKA with 50 000 watts and all the heritage against KQV the first ABC owned station to make the switch to top 40 In October 1975 KQV ended the top forty era of its illustrious history and began serving Pittsburgh with an All News format The last night of the top 40

control of the Cleveland facility and the station became WKYC KYW is the only radio station in history to operate from three different markets in four moves Three years after moving to Cleveland KYW

broadcast the results of the Harding Cox Presidential election KDKA wasn t the first broadcaster but the station s claim as the first is correct if you consider that it was the first commercial radio station to be issued a broadcasting license It was KDKA that hired the first full time radio announcer in broadcast history when Harold W Arlin came on board as the station s staff announcer Arlin introduced many great celebrities such as William Jennings Bryan and Will Rogers KDKA was also first with a regularly scheduled church service in January 1921 as well as first with the broadcast of a Professional Baseball Game between the Pirates and Phillies in August of the same year By 1946 KDKA was still broadcasting the Farm Hour News every weekday morning at six along with a full service format inlcuding news sports interviews and play by play coverage of the Pirates Penquins and Steelers In the late 50 s KDKA began blending top forty music into their format and the battle of Pittsburgh was on But with the help of its powerful TV outlet KDKA (Channel 2) Clark Race was able to stay ahead of KQV in spite of the fact that KQV was rocking around the clock while KDKA was airing live sports events By the late 60 s and 70 s KDKA and KQV were joined in the top forty battle by two other AM rockers 13Q and WIXZ But the 50 000 watt KDKA continued to dominate the Pittsburgh market

zenith during six years in the Insurance City (1960 1966) His light and lively morning show was peppered with comedy drop ins (his special favorite was Stan Freberg ) and he was a master at excerpting clips from commercials as part of the buildup to a spot Watching Landry work must have been a treat As a tune was spinning he would record half a conversation using a character voice through the audition channel of the console The engineer would rewind it and wait for a cue Then Landry did the other half of the conversation in his own voice live His timing and use of sound effects was superb During his last year at Big D Ron also hosted Scene 18 a weekly Bandstand type show on a local TV station On this morning Landry decides to get a shave down at the WDRC Barber Shop Note the mention of

Greer (d 1996) from January 26 1965 which includes the first 30 minutes of the 5AM hour Like Charlie s 1969 aircheck it s unlikely that this was recorded from WABC AM In fact it s possible it was recorded from WABC FM Those call letters are included in the Charlie Greer Charlie Greer Jimmy Wallington newscast in the last five minutes of this exhibit But it probably came from Mr Greer s private

days were confined to the Strip (which extended only as far south as the Hacienda Hotel and Casino now the site of the Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino) along with a short stretch of the Boulder Highway and Fremont Street in the downtown area Back then cars could drive on Fremont all the way to First Street and the sounds of Radio KENO poured into the warm night air from the windows of nearly every car that cruised down glitter gulch past The MInt Casino & Hotel the Golden Nugget the Horseshoe Club the Fremont Hotel & Casino and the El Cortez Hotel & Casino Coffee Jim Dandy Mark Lane Uncle Bob Martin Bill Wood Jr Dave Ambrose Corky Mayberry Scott Morgan Jeff Colson and Jim Blaine  some of the Radio KENO Good Guys during that era  were mobbed when they made public appearances in their natty Color Radio Channel 146 blazer jackets KENO always had special meaning for me During my early teenage years in the San Fernando Valley in the northern part of Los Angeles I enjoyed DX ing (listening to distant radio stations at night) and requesting QSL (reception verification cards) from radio stations that I picked up One of those stations was KENO which invited me to visit the station My folks vacationed in Vegas a few times each year and in December 1963 I took KENO up on its offer The KENO studios and transmitter site were on a sand blown patch of land a couple of hundred yards northeast of the intersection of Flamingo and Paradise roads The station s jocks  notably Mark Lane Coffee Jim and Jeff Colson  gave me an undeservedly warm welcome and allowed me to hang around the station while my folks headed to the casinos As a means of thanking the KENO jocks for their hospitality I began to aircheck L A radio stations and took the tapes with me on my recurring visits to KENO One of the ReelRadio subscribers who listened to this aircheck commented that he noticed the similarity between some KENO formatic elements and those of KRLA Pasadena I was partly responsible for that The KENO Good Guys were particularly interested in my airchecks of KRLA which like KENO had a distinctive unique sound As soon as I would arrive at KENO the jocks would escort me into a production room rack up my latest aircheck tape on an Ampex open reel machine and study it intently Throughout the mid 60s I was KENO s teenage conduit to L A radio Still KENO did not mirror KRLA it merely adapted a few imaging concepts but gave them a distinctly Vegas feel KENO engaged in day parting: varying its approach to appeal to differing audience compositions at various times throughout the broadcast day Morning guy Coffee Jim was zany quick and sometimes mildly risquê Midday guy Mark Lane a family man had a more subdued approach to appeal to parents at home or at work The tempo kicked up again during afternoon drive And because KENO was the only top 40 station in town in the mid 60s the station wasn t shy about testing new records on the air KENO took chances on some klunkers but broke some really good records that would have become national hits if only music directors at other stations would have had as much courage or sense of adventure Upon hearing this aircheck Uncle Ricky observed This is an amazing unscoped hour of mid morning KENO We get the last half hour of Coffee Jim Dandy and the first half hour of Mark Lane plus two local newscasts and Whitney Bolton with Mutual News In fact the aircheck opens and ends with the Mutual news sounder The music selection is an absolute delight for me I was only 15 in 1966 when this aircheck was recorded I freely admit I had not heard several of these songs before and I had a daily radio show! Coffee Jim is wrong about the year The Playmates had their biggest hit and Mark Lane has a much more familiar mix even with the required Tony Vann song All of it is too delightful Comments for the Coffee Jim Dandy KENO exhibit that precedes this one are interesting Coffee Jim himself stopped by years ago Regardless of the individual songs listeners tuned in to hear KENO and what the Good Guys had to say Throughout the mid 60s KENO was the the most prominent sound of Vegas Imagine yourself heading out the door of the Sands or the Stardust or the Silver Slipper Casino after enjoying a 69 cent buffet breakfast and making a quick couple of passes in your favor on the craps table The pockets of your pants are bulging with jangling silver dollars as you stride across the expanse of asphalt in the balmy morning air unlock the door of your car turn the ignition key and twist your radio dial to 1460 Listen and you re there [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository [g250 gif] TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (10Khz) [play gif] Dave Hull KRLA Los Angeles August 18 1966 (01:01:25) Play Scoped This Exhibit SCOPED (24:52) [iplay gif] UNSCOPED [iplay gif] SCOPED Dodgers Stadium becomes Beatles Stadium Sunday August 28th Dave Hull who early in 1964 toiled 9 midnight on KRLA (1110 kHz 50kw D/10kw N the big 11 10 serving Greater Los Angeles from Pasadena ) soared to prominence after closely identifying himself with Beatlemania Shifted quickly to afternoon drive Hull tossed out the regular playlist and cleared a path for the main forces of the British invasion The Hullaballooer punctuated his show with Beatle interview drop ins and blasts from his hoarse sounding India taxicab horn As the screams of Beatlemania faded away with the Fab Four s farewell concert tour in the summer of 1966 KRLA shifted from its traditional top 30 Tune Dex to a short lived all request format In that summer of 66 KRLA held strong blaring Donovan the Kinks and the Fab Four from tinny 6 transistor radios dotting the beaches of Southern California from Malibu to Laguna This aircheck (4 5 PM August 18 1966) captures Dave Hull in top form his ties to the Beatles still strongly evident Also included: Danny Baxter with sports and Jim Steck with an excellent long newscast A scoped version of this exhibit was originally published on August 31 1997 A new transfer of the original exhibit and a restored version of this exhibit was published on July 26 2015 [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository [g250 gif] TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (10Khz) [play gif] Tom Clay KDAY Santa Monica (LA) August 19 1966 (34:31) Play Scoped This Exhibit SCOPED (13:45) Phone and Listen Ring and Swing [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Jeff March] This rare and restored exhibit features the legendary Tom Clay on Million Dollar Request Radio KDAY in Santa Monica a suburb of Los Angeles It could also have been called phone number radio as Clay spends most of his air time reciting the names of various L A suburbs and the corresponding numbers to call for requests As I remember Tom Clay worked in Detroit before and after his time in L A Russ Porterfield is featured with news on this recording made between 9:58 and 10:30 AM on Friday August 19 1966 Not only are the requests from all over the Los Angeles area the playlist includes hits from 1937 to 1966 on the 29th day of this format How long did this format last?

[ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION BY CONTRIBUTOR JEFF MARCH ] Until the spring of 1965 KHJ was one of perhaps nine traditional MOR (middle of the road) stations doing the same old thing in L A KHJ s fare included a nightly folk music program hosted by British announcer Michael Jackson (later to gravitate to talk radio at KABC) The debut of KHJ s polished Boss Radio format in April 1965 turned L A radio on its ears By the summer of 66 simulcasting KHJ not only had shaken the AM radio establishment but presaged the awakening of FM for youth oriented formats While 93/KHJ drive anchors Robert W Morgan and The Real Don Steele were permitted little adjustments in formatics to express their personas the other Boss Jocks just hammered out straight on Boss Radio Such was the case with Frank Terry captured on this aircheck taped during KHJ s heyday in September 1966 Frank Terry passed away June 21 2007 following a ten year battle with cancer Gary Mack who is featured for the last 19 minutes of this recording went into broadcast management at WSB Atlanta [TECHNICAL NOTE: The UNscoped version includes a burst of hiss from an unknown source It begins at approximately 41:05 and continues until 42:50

January 11 2013 71) always had a smile in his voice He entered the Los Angeles radio market at KRLA in 1959 moved four years later to Color Channel 98 KFWB where he remained for four years At the time of this aircheck KFWB was facing competition from KHJ AM & FM and KRLA as well as from KBLA Burbank from oldies formatted KDAY Santa Monica and KWIZ Santa Ana and from R&B formatted KGFJ Los Angeles and XERB Rosarito B C Mexico The KFWB air staff then consisted of Wink Martindale in morning drive followed by Gene Weed (9 a m noon) Larry McCormick (noon 3 p m ) O Neill (3 6) B Mitchel Reed (6 9) Joe Yocam (9 midnight) and Bill Taylor (midnight 6 a m ) During the previous summer O Neill and other KFWB jocks testified in closed door hearings that the FCC was conducting into alleged West Coast payola activities O Neill was dismissed from the action in late August Note that as of the time of this aircheck KFWB ran news straight up at the top of the hour abandoning its tradition of running news at :55 KFWB treated its news as an integral part of the programming with a staff of well respected local newscasters including Bill Angel and Beach Rogers heard here The station even plugged the contents of upcoming newscasts (you ll hear that about 51 minutes into this aircheck) In contrast to KHJ s tight formatting KFWB s relaxed approach sounded closer to middle of the road station KMPC O Neill who was host of the ABC television program Shindig (1964 66) also was owner of the Pandora s Box teen nightclub on Sunset Boulevard crowds at which prompted aggressive police enforcement of a 10 p m curfew that prompted protests and confrontations with police in November 1966 that the Buffalo Springfield memorialized in the song For What It s Worth O Neill joined the air staff of KDAY in 1969 for two years then returned to KRLA in the mid 80s for a couple of stints before retiring from on air work in 1993 Technical notes: I recorded this aircheck at my parents home in Van Nuys on a Wollensak T 1500 half track mono recorder at 7 1/2 i p s from the line level audio output of a Sony TR 814 8 transistor radio This recording was contributed exclusively to REELRADIO Do not duplicate

DJ of the Year: Listen and laugh to legends like Wally Phillips and Dick Whittington and you understand why they made six figure salaries when an average salary was more like $25 000 in 1971 Poor pay for an industry that made so much money was radio s dirty little secret Rumors about so & so making $200 000 or the assumption that if you were in Philadelphia or San Francisco you made a million were myths Most jocks and PD s did not discuss what they really made If not for voice over and personal appearances many guys were struggling The low pay was a disgrace and yet real tribute must go to the

McMurray s approach was the Where It All Began promotional series excerpted here [lilplay gif] In the Spring of 1970 the ARB showed WBT as the overall ninth station in the market No longer could Blair and its powerful Blair radio Network (BRN) feed WBT the national clients David Klemm Blair s secret agent acted as the CIA of Blair and all the stations they represented He knew the score and more about every major market radio station in America than anyone at that time He was a smart articulate and brilliant communicator He was very well liked respected and a truly nice guy David s job bottom line was to keep Blair stations number one it would take hard factual data to get permission from Jefferson Standard to shorten the skirts on their Grand Lady Jefferson Standard Broadcasting was a subsidiary of Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company WBT its sisters WBT FM and WBTV TV along with some other broadcast properties had been a virtual cash cow and a place to showcase the parent corporation Life insurance companies like Jefferson Standard worked as monolithic autocratic organizations They understood actuary tables They for sure did not like change especially with tradition and WBT was high on their list when it came to tradition Getting Jefferson Standard to accept change was General Manager Harold Hinson s problem He knew David Klemm was right Secretly working with David Klemm Harold devised a plan to have a palace coup If WBT was going to change it would take hard factual data to get permission from Jefferson Standard to shorten the skirts on their Grand Lady  WBT From August through September I worked totally behind the scenes I was not even in or near the station I designed quantitative and qualitative research that was performed by Mel Goldberg s New York based Magic C research company The WBT/PAMS Custom jingles used a new musical signature christened Logo One and featured a unique vocal arrangement with muted brass [lilplay gif] I had always worked with a specific plan using research in my previous programming but to have this kind of resource was fantastic Few programmers had this kind of luxury With Mel s help I devised a questionnaire and survey along with various recordings The recordings on cassette tape had representative cuts of every conceivable kind of music I wanted to know if people identified Yesterday by the Beatles as a Top 40 song Did they even know it was the Beatles? Did they hear Mr Bojangles as a country song Top 40 awful noise or what? There were thirty various samples played to see if people knew what music was what and how they identified it Most importantly we wanted to know what they liked Questions also elicited various demographic and economic information attitudes and preferences on all different kinds of programming We played all air personalities voices currently in the region and sought to find out if they could identify the personality without hearing their name or station Mel and a crew of seven experienced researchers fanned out through 78 counties in North Carolina South Carolina Virginia and Tennessee Thousands of people were personally interviewed Mainframe computers compiled the data Mel interpreted the facts Harold myself and a professional writer prepared concise white papers for the Jefferson Standard hierarchy I know of no other PD afforded the time and budget given me by WBT to produce a totally new sound and indeed new radio station Harold presented the research reports along with the hard data which was as thick as two New York City telephone books to Wally Jorgensen Executive VP of Broadcasting After digesting the data Wally approved and got Harold an audience with Charlie Crutchfield the President of JS Broadcasting That done and with Mr Crutchfield now a believer a special board of directors meeting was arranged for the entire Jefferson Standard Life (now Jefferson Pilot) Corporation This stuff was all beyond my personal view and involvement In September 1970 the Jefferson Standard board approved all recommendations and I began to build the new WBT Veteran TV game show announcer Johnny Olsen was featured on jock intros show closings and promos [lilplay gif] I know of no other PD afforded the time and budget given me by WBT to produce a totally new sound and indeed new radio station I was allowed $200 000 00 to build a new sound studios and entertainment team Good bad and great things happened 28 people were fired all given generous buy outs or early retirement I know of no other broadcaster ever who had been so kind to it s employees Over the next five months three major studios were reconstructed and state of the art equipment installed A new staff was blended with some of WBT s traditional announcers so that an evolutionary (as opposed to revolutionary) sound would first hit the air when WBT changed formats in March 1971 As early as January 1971 two top 40 DJ s Rob Hunter and H A Thompson were hired but kept in the wings [past gif] On Monday March 8th WBT announced that on Sunday March 14th at 7 PM WBT will become a thing of the past and that an official announcement would be made at that time by WBT General manager Harold Hinson It was strongly implied that the station was going off the air WBT never in it s life had done any stunts It was a graceful 50 000 watt tradition [lilplay gif] At 7 PM on March 14th an official announcement was read and WBT started it s new format with the Original Sunday Night Hall of Fame [snhof gif] The next morning Charlotte had a new radio station In one of the most courageous moves I have ever seen WBT sales manager Cullie Tarleton had canceled hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue so that we could have a clean top 40 sound with no more than 14 commercial units per hour I literally gutted the old WBT canceling CBS and dozens of programs and features that were all rating killers but well funded by local advertisers Over the next 2 years WBT attained the highest ARB ratings ever recorded by any station ever or since in the Charlotte metro area WBT was Number One in every time period and every demographic I have never had seen or felt the magic fun and success of the WBT years before or since WBT was one in a million What to say?

& Wall The Mad Mexican Bruce Miller Earle Chris Michaels Stan Main Keith Morgan Bill O Brian and Cosmos plus IDs and jingles By Keith Morgan September 1 1977 XEROK was ALIVE and with LIVE jocks Up until this time the X was tape delay and as history shows John Long did the very best he could at getting the Mexican Operator/Engineers to play the right tape for that hour and Mr Long s ratings were proof that teamwork is a winning concept I had no idea of what I was about to endure having arrived in El Paso the week earlier Chris Michaels acting PD at the time hired me to do weekends and swing shifts Stan Main gave me directions from the Cielo Vista Bank building where we had our Management and Production studios Back in 1977 the Cielo Vista Mall was just about the end of east El Paso on 1 10 It was around 20 miles to Zaragoza where the transmitter and studio were housed and that 20 miles was in the middle of nothing desert Following Stan s directions I proceeded towards the Border Zaragoza is a small dot on the map about 20 miles South East of Mexico s fourth largest city Juarez The XeROK 80 tower stands just under 400 feet and is lit up like a typical European AM antenna A tandem set of amber tower lights marked every 20 feet making it look bigger than life There were two old adobe buildings The bigger building enclosed the Engineer s office work room and the 1972 Continental Electronics 150b medium wave flame thrower A smaller building about fifty feet from the main building housed a very simple studio Autogram IC lO board two ITC triple decks two Shure SM 5 B microphones one Collins R 390A receiver (for reception of Sunday nights Mexican National Hour (from XEW in Mexico City)) a hybrid tri band audio processor and an old Ampex 351 (We had no shortage of reel to reel machines on both sides of the border ) Even with several layers of RF screening around the studio building the X still had a real problem keeping RF out of places like the telephone and recorder heads You could feel the power in the air as you walked around the site not to mention the pressure one would feel on and through ones body when you stand in front of the beast on full power Being live on the air at XeROK was such a privilege I knew fiom the very first day that this wasn t your everyday radio station My first night on the air (11p 3a) I received phone calls from listeners in Melbourne FL Davenport IA Pocatello ID and assorted calls from all of the Western states We would receive letters of Reception and DX reports from all over Western Canada Western and Central North America all of Mexico Central and South America We also had listeners writing from Eastern Australia and the Pacific Asian Rim I remember driving to work one night  They call it a highway there s room for maybe two cars The last mile before the station I noticed the highway lights flickering and going dim then bright all in synch with the modulation of the transmitter Every Sunday night we would go off for maintenance and cleaning When we came back on we would run audio tones for alignment The highway lights hated those tones they would dim to nothing and in an instant would be so bright its a wonder how they would not explode The transmission feed was open line 150 000 watts would flow and hum across the cables connection the antenna to the transmitter Birds would land on the line and in a flash they would be vaporized only a handful of feathers would float to the ground On a wet rainy day RF would flow down the tower support lines which made the insulators turn orange red and a loud gun like bang could be heard for several yards As I said there was nothing normal about XeROK When the President of Mexico wanted to speak to his people all Radio and Television Stations would stop normal programming and carry him live Some of our commercials were in Spanish Mexican electricity is not as consistent as ours here in the States so some of the cart and tape machines would have speed variations from time to time And of course this was Mexico 1977 All of us Jocks always had in the back of our minds the threat of some underworld terrorist group marching in with guns drawn to commandeer our facility for their own wants and demands (Maybe we all were watching too many movies ) Then there was the time some needy neighbors came one night and stole the brand new copper ground radials that Bruce Earle and the Mexican Engineers had just laid the day earlier How they did not get fried is still a wonder to us On the way home there were always the US customs agents as I crossed the Border for three years I knew them and their names and they knew my name yet several times each month it was my turn in the barrel The FCC hated us You know it s strange I remember like yesterday Bruce Earle telling me he only wished the FCC Inspectors would come over and see first hand what we were doing XeROK 800 is licensed for 150 000 Watts non directional International Clear Channel We ran 142 KWs at high power and on low power we ran 52KWs The transmitter building was clean no spotless You could eat off the floor (I wouldn t ) The transmitter was cleaned and maintained weekly without fail Mr Earle would check tolerances and tweak the transmitter daily The FCC would have been proud of our installation and XeROK had a killer signal to test the new AM Stereo on Even the Inspectors from the Mexican FCC The SCT (Secretary of Communications and Transports) inspected the main transmitter room but they preferred lengthy visits in the engineers office where they would check out the logs and paperwork say everything is ok and leave Crazy Years It was a wild and crazy time those years in radio Radio wasn t work It was some kind of game played by extremely creative people who were bright beyond meaning or comprehension It was a time when gray haired old men with degrees galore hung around young kids to find out what was going on It was a time when getting noticed and known was not enough only becoming famous would do And money was merely a byproduct that came with success and as easily lost as gained but with vast indifference as a rule whether rich or poor Everyone I knew was interesting And their lives and the things they did fascinating! No more so than the evening we dined on steaks carved from bulls that had probably lost a battle in a nearby bullring that day steaks basted in hot sauce that built a fire in your gut which only Tecate could cool Armed with more Tecate we went out to the XEROK transmitter in the hard dark of night and Bruce Earle showed me bootprints literally engraved in solid concrete and told me the story of the old engineer who d come out to the transmitter on the night of a storm to turn back on the transmitter just as a bolt of lightning hit the antenna Those bootprints were valid proof that the business of radio could sometimes be as dangerous as it was exciting That night we took neon tubes and danced and yelled in their macabre light out under the antenna no batteries necessary and that was valid proof to me that in spite of everything radio was almost the most exciting thing on earth or anywhere It s strange that I remember these things after all these years and countless wonderful experiences in radio But remember them I do and I will never forget could never forget the amazing men and women I ve met and grown to love with a terrible intensity and range of emotions in the wonderful world of radio God was indeed good to me Claude Hall September 2000 We ran our own boat At that time in history were the ONLY Mexican Radio Station that allowed Americans to talk touch the equipment and produce our shows live on location! During the same time English Border Blasters in the California Baja were being fed via 7 5 Khz phone lines from Stateside studios The X was one of a kind I was 20 years old I only wish I knew then what I know now One of my most treasured moments at the X was one Summer s night I was doing my show around 11PM Bruce Earle walked into the studio and behind him was this middle aged man with super thick glasses  I will never forget those thick lens in his glasses Bruce said Morgan I want you to meet one of my very dearest and oldest friends Claude Hall and Bruce then pushed me aside and went into a hour on air live interview with Claude They talked about other high power U S stations I remember Mr Hall saying if we were to mention other stations and their calls on the air like we were doing it could get us in big trouble with the FCC but I guess we don t need to worry about that Claude Hall said God has been good to me hearing that from the Radio Editor of Billboard Magazine and looking back I feel God was good to all of us The X was indeed one of a kind and I thank God every day for the opportunity to be a part of Radio History The Mighty XeROK 80 will live forever in the hearts of those of us that had the privilege of playing Rock n roll and speaking English live on the most powerful AM radio station of North America in its day X ROK 80 [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 0Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] KINT El Paso TX Composite 1977 (12:51) write it down 98 times Featured: Robert Scott Sonny Rio Jhani Kaye Jerry Wilson and lots of promos and jingles!

I fell in love with radio and everything it had to offer I didn t get into broadcasting until I was stationed during the conflict at Blytheville Arkansas for the Air Force (not one enemy fighter made it past me) I witnessed the start of WMC FM aka FM 100 in Memphis I worked at KLCN in Blytheville and tried to get it to sound good too During that period of time I returned home and recorded some tapes to take back with me to the airbase This is how I happened to get these gems from some legends! I think you ll enjoy AS for my career after leaving KLCN I went to KGY in Olympia to KALE in the Tri Cities to KNDO TV in Yakima (oops a wrong move there) then to KRKO and KWYZ in Everett Some brief stints in Seattle and then into sales for Trader Publishing Company (I needed to make some money) I was at Trader for 9 years now retired and loving it!

Also included here is audio that Matt Seinberg acquired from Ron shortly before his passing Craig Allen also contributed a few unscoped items that he personally recorded off the air in Philly There were a few stations that employed Ron that were not represented so I added a few extras from my own collection to make the archive complete The Repository thanks Big Ron O Brien s friends for sharing!

involvement with radio He s pictured here in a high school yearbook ad with lifelong buddy Lance Jones whose father Haskell gave him his first paying job in broadcasting By the time he was four James O Neal knew that he wanted to be in broadcasting He grew up in the southwest Arkansas town of Hope and recalls as a toddler wandering into his grandmother s bedroom and hearing a man with a really great voice stating that he was speaking from Radio City in New York and advising to tune in tomorrow at the same time and station The seed was planted with O Neal realizing that he had to find out how it was possible to hear someone so far away speaking to him While in the fifth grade (1958) O Neal constructed a low power AM pirate station inviting friends to join him after school and on weekends in playing radio A few years later (the start of junior high school) he had even constructed a mobile unit for his bicycle allowing him or his buddies to cover breaking events (such as they might be) within a couple of blocks of his studio [bio 2 jpg] O Neal spent his 20th summer working an evening shift at Texarkana s KTFS One of his junior high buddies turned out to be the son of the manager of the local AM station (the only radio station in the entire county) Following a Friday night sleepover party this buddy invited his dad to see O Neal s radio station and witness its performance Within a few days the friend approached O Neal at school with the message that Dad wants to know if you d like to go to work at his station KXAR Of course this was an offer that couldn t be resisted and in a short time (just a few weeks shy of his 14th birthday) O Neal found himself spinning records and reading spots at the real deal This employment forever silenced his pirate operation The air work continued through high school and into college (the University of Arkansas) with O Neal working at the likes of KFAY KTFS KSPR and KFAV FM to help cover the costs of higher education and thoroughly enjoying himself in the process [bio 3 jpg] By happenstance O Neal found himself constructing a television studio while studying at the University of Arkansas This experience eventually pushed him into a nearly 37 year long career in television engineering As much as he liked being on the air O Neal was even more intrigued by the engineering side of things (witness the low power AM rig constructed while in grade school) prompting him to eventually obtain the coveted FCC First Phone and handling equipment repairs for the stations he worked for Somewhere along the way word of this reached one of the University s colleges and he was called in by an associate dean who asked if he would be interested in constructing a small television studio from some rather antique gear donated by a cable TV company O Neal succeeded in getting the junk to work and setting up the studio (learning a great deal about television engineering in the process) This knowledge would come in handy a couple of years later when the college town got its first TV station an NBC affiliated UHF operation O Neal was hired by the fledgling operation a few months before he graduated college with duties ranging from running the mountaintop transmitter (1 5 megawatts ERP) setting up microwave hops hosting interview shows and even anchoring the station s news block for a while (In the background he continued jocking at an associated good music FM under the air name of Edward James ) [bio 5 jpg] O Neal poses with a 1930s vintage shortwave transmitter originally used to transmit Third Reich propaganda from a site near Munich Germany It was liberated during the occupation of Germany and was still in use by the VOA at the time of his visit to the station in the late 1980s Television engineering eventually won out over air work with O Neal leaving Arkansas in 1976 to continue a nearly 37 year long career in that field This included more than 30 years with the television side of the Voice of America Employment with this international broadcasting organization provided him with an opportunity for extensive foreign travel and opened the doors for visits to radio and television facilities around the world He officially retired from broadcasting in 2005 but immediately launched a second career in journalism which continued for almost another decade He signed on that year as technology editor at TV Technology magazine and also began writing for a sister publication Radio World and other periodicals concentrating largely on radio s colorful history and the individuals who helped to make it possible (And along the way he uncovered some interesting facts That great story which a lot of us radio folks know about Reginald Fessenden inventing broadcasting on Christmas Eve 1906 cannot be substantiated ) [bio 9 jpg] O Neal today as he relaxes in the control room of his replica AM radio station The RCA 74 ribbon mic Collins 212 B audio console and Gates turntables came from the station where he got his first radio job KXAR O Neal s lifelong love of broadcasting radio continues on the dual fronts of hardware and software (equipment and programming) He still enjoys listening to distant AM stations at night via the magic of skywave propagation operates a ham radio station (licensed as K4XAR) researches and writes about radio and television and serves as editor of a periodical devoted to broadcasting for one of the professional societies of which he s a life member He serves on the boards of two radio and television oriented museums and has constructed a complete full scale working replica of the first station at which he was employed (Hope Arkansas s KXAR) with much of the gear coming from that station The replica includes control room studio reception area and a full complement of 40s/50s vintage equipment including a one kW Collins transmitter AP Teletype frequency/modulation monitoring gear and a CONELRAD receiver (remember those?) During his nearly 60 years of involvement in broadcasting O Neal has accumulated recordings of thousands of hours of programming including a number of radio airchecks from the 1960s and 70s and is now happy to share these with you The Repository thanks James O Neal for sharing!

And what about our adult listeners? So many stations especially those serving medium markets reached a compromise: daytime programming would he reserved for middle of the road programming with plenty of Percy Faith Johnny Mathis and the Living Strings Rock n roll would be reserved for the evenings That s when the kids were listening weren t they? And who ever heard of an adult listening to rock n roll? CFPL RADIO 98 AM news talk entertainment It was at such a station Dick Williams worked in the 1960 s His clever fast paced humor driven show became stuff of legend for CFPL s southwestern Ontario listeners and one listen to this tape will show why One can only assume that Williams had plenty of offers to work in a larger market with higher compensation but he spurned them all to work in the charming friendly city of London Ont Thousands of listeners there thank him still!

reflected the programming genius of long time PD Larry Andersen Some of Buffalo s most legendary personalities worked at WGR during its heyday as a contemporary music station from 1972 to 1989 Stan Roberts George Hamberger and Tom Shannon all did stints in morning drive with Andersen Joe Galusky and Craig Matthews appearing in middays during that period The witty Frank Benny did afternoon drive

version of the syndicated History of Rock and Roll Time Sweep you ll hear narrator Bill Drake offer the above comment concerning considerable carryover just before the magic music and memories begin

Top 40 radio was NOT Rock & Roll radio Some rock music was presented in a variety format known as Top 40  and that may have helped it become the dominant form of American popular music This Time Sweep should really be titled The History of Number One Records on Top 40 Radio from 1956 1981 Since then diversification of formats new and specialized outlets for recorded music and the mass marketing of highly polarized musical forms (ie: suburbanites identifying with urban cowboys and inner city hoodlums) has all but eliminated what was once the most loved and popular musical format on the radio Top 40 was special because it was NOT just Rock n Roll It was NEVER just one type of popular contemporary music While the final History of Rock & Roll may never be written the History of Top 40 Radio is in the books It s all done if not forgotten [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository REMASTERED FRESH G2 ORIGINAL ENCODING RA3 MARCH 28 1999 RE ENCODED RA8 JANUARY 19 2003 TOP STREAM 32Kbps 16Khz [play gif] Dan Ingram Ron Lundy WABC New York May 10 1982 (40:27) This is the last time I ll be able to say this WABC New York It has been called the day the music died On May 10 1982 WABC Musicradio ended its music format of more than 21 years when it switched to a talk format at the stroke of noon The format went out in style as long time WABC deejays and personal friends Ron Lundy and Dan Ingram co hosted the last show The last minutes of WABC s music format were consumed with a medley of the stations number one songs over the year That was followed by an emotional goodbye from Lundy and Ingram and then Imagine by John Lennon After Imagine faded out the WABC Chime Jingle was played for the last time followed by a brief pause and then the first WABC Talkradio jingle was heard One era had ended and another had begun [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository [g250 gif] TOP STREAM 32Kbps (10Khz) [play gif] Farewell WKBW WWKB Buffalo NY June 1988 (05:29) WKBW now becomes a thing of the past [Description by Dale Patterson ] A jingle heard on the station near the end said KB forever It wasn t On June 18 1988 an emotional Tom Donahue said goodbye to live assist oldies at WWKB Buffalo N Y ending an era that started nearly 30 years before On July 4 1958 WKBW began playing Top 40 music and a legend was born With a powerful signal that reached 17 states and  in the words of Dick Biondi  everyone up there in Canada KB radio grew over the years into one of the greatest Top 40 stations in North America Joey Reynolds Dan Neaverth Stan Roberts Don Berns Sandy Beach Jackson Armstrong Tom Shannon Fred Klestine and Shane were among the many who presented music shows Irv Weinstein Jim Fagan Henry Brach John Zach Jim McLaughlin and others anchored a stand out news department a pioneer in the presentation of news in the Top 40 format There wasn t a dry eye in the house when Donahue said farewell that muggy night in 1988 as KB switched to a satellite oldies format He went with a great collage of KB music moments and memories Western New York/Southern Ontario radio has never been the same After the final broadcast I phoned Donahue and asked if he would send me a tape of the last show He did and it is presented here [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository The Dale Patterson Collection has been part of REELRADIO since May 10 1998 [wwwrrcom gif] Reel Top 40 Radio Repository ©1996 2004 REELRADIO Inc');

and roll Picture of Daryl B Daryl B Although not typical Daryl B this composite combines two unique events in his career The aircheck begins with the only time that CKLG ever made #1 in the official Canadian BBM (Board of Broadcast Measurement) ratings for Vancouver: the broadcast of the original History of Rock & Roll during Ratings Week Not a small feat considering it marks the only time in more than 45 years that information station CKNW was not #1 Picture of Rick Honey Rick Honey The remainder of this composite is Daryl s only guest appearance on CKLG FM doing the second of three monthly specials that the station did using AM DJs Events dictated the topic: supergroup Buffalo Springfield had just broken up on May 5 Daryl knew group member Neil Young through his best friend Rick Honey who played in a Winnipeg garage band with Neil hence the we references during the special Because the original recording was made for the music not as an aircheck the commercials were removed which accounts for the awkward transition between certain sentences: there was actually a commercial in between Daryl Burlingham came to Vancouver and CFUN in late 1965 from CKY Winnipeg having previously been at CKRC Winnipeg and CFQC Saskatoon In March 1967 he moved to CKLG staying until he got the opportunity to join CKLW Windsor near the end of 1969 But he missed the West Coast and returned to CKLG in August 1970 moving back to CFUN shortly after CHUM Toronto bought them in 1973 then to CHUM itself in the early 80s until Post Polio Syndrome forced his retirement Even if you do not remember the distinctive voice you always knew it was Daryl because he ended his show with the phrase Stay out of Trees This CKLG FM broadcast may be the only time in his career that he did not say it CKLG 73 CKLG AM had just celebrated its 10th anniversary when it changed format from The Foreground Sound to Top 40 on August 22 1964 the day the Beatles first came to Vancouver Lloyd Moffat had purchased the station in 1961 but his unexpected death earlier in 1964 left his young song Randy with 8 radio stations across Western Canada that he quickly changed to Top 40 CKLG remained with its format and call letters until it became the All News sister station to CKNW on February 1 2001 Meanwhile the Muzak inspired Foreground Sound moved to CKLG FM still unable to compete against CHQM s dominance in that format In 1967 LG FM tested the appeal of an Underground format with a weekly program of New World African music as host Bill Reiter likes to call it Groovin Blue expanded to daily and by early 1968 the station hired John Runge from CKUA Edmonton as Music Director and went Underground full time They explored the full range of the format even playing some classical but eventually settled into progressive rock popular cuts from popular rock LPs before self destructing in the mid 70s in a failed unionization attempt Their focus and call letters changed to CFOX shortly after Picture of Daryl B Daryl Burlingham May 1970 At age 58 Daryl B passed away February 27 2001 in Winnipeg having suffered a massive stroke shortly after hearing of Rick Honey s death Rick spent most of his career more than 20 years at CKNW where he was usually heard on afternoon drive CKNW hired him from CKLG during a period of recruiting top young local radio personalities Rick started out at 16 at CJOB Winnipeg then to Northern Ontario and the Maritimes before CKLG Rick died in Vancouver after a long battle with throat cancer February 24 2001 at the age of 54 His last air shift was morning

station in the Pacific Northwest: great jingles great DJs great music great chart several excellent singles never made Billboard s Hot 100 but were heard on KGA The Superhit Survey was a Top 30 with another 11 DJ picks and a list of 10 albums Listen and hear how they flushed it all away in less than 10 minutes They stuck it out for another month but their credibility and listeners gone KGA switched formats to C&W and the air staff left According to a book on Promotion this same scenario was tried at a Texas station several months earlier with similar results They should have known better Outside of Spokane you had to wait for sunset to hear KGA but then it usually came in like a local from San Diego to Vancouver and through the Rockies That made Shane s 6 10pm program the station s most popular He ended each night talking emotionally over most of Barbra Streisand s People He was always extremely competent so he must have been very nervous about this plan given all the mistakes in this aircheck Rumor has it he went to Top 40 CKXL in Calgary to capitalize on KGA s listeners there but no one has heard of him since On a personal note more because I thought it was a

HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? Lan Roberts Promotional Picture 1969 Hallowe en 1969 was a day to remember on KOL Lan Roberts (d December 30 2005) created the ultimate promotional vehicle with The World s First International Garbage Record Festival to draw listeners to The World s First International Garbage Film Festival At midnight Hallowe en night a chain of six local theatres was showing a double bill of rotten films Billy the Kid versus Dracula and Jesse James Meets Frankenstein s Daughter were both misguided attempts from three years earlier to combine Western and Horror genres Amongst the rotten records aired only two ever made Billboard s Hot 100 and were not on that week s KOL chart Certainly a major departure for 7:03 a m in Morning Drive when this aircheck begins It ends with more usual morning fare including two songs from the chart that week even if one starts at 78 rpm and the other was a local hit in the Jet City The commentary on current news items was a Lan trademark heard as the aircheck tape rolls off the end of the reel Other trademarks heard during the festival itself include Lan s Hollywood Reporter and Phil Dirt characters As well as two songs about Phil you will also find that Phil finds something definitely erotic about the sound of trains As odd as this hour is the height in oddity is reached as listener Patty McKnight drops by during Lan s show and lends him her copy of The KJR Concerto which Lan airs complete with dated KJR jingles When it s over the Hollywood Reporter even refers to KJR s most famous name: Pat O Day Lan Roberts and Robert O Smith Lan Roberts and Robert O Smith Hallowe en had been heavily promoted for more than a month on KOL In addition to the International Garbage Record Festival Afternoon Drive was highlighted by two airings of Robert O Smith s Hallowe en Horror Movie As for KOL jingles during this period they were often experiments and changed frequently You will only hear two here one following the first train record and a second at 56:38 into the aircheck The truth is several of the DJs just did not like jingles KOL Letterhead KOL Letterhead Don Chambers does news headlines at 20 past the hour and complete news at 20 to the

sounded this good First thanks to FM simulcasting frequency response holds steady to 14 500 Hz on this aircheck many studio checks of that era do not sound this good Second Robert O has every attribute I look for in a DJ: both a knowledge and love of the music a smaller than usual ego and technical competence with something interesting to say Plus much more: intelligent humor political satire and voices of famous people and those of his own invention This being Thanksgiving morning Robert O is a little more laid back casual as his Eloise Hugaboom character puts it than on his typical weekday morning drive show But he has not left his regular cast of characters at home He even makes the most of the fact that the new jingles are late by trying his hand at singing his own Commercial buffs will enjoy the classic Janet Leigh ad especially with Robert O s great Hitchcock Psycho lead in By my calculation I listened to more than a thousand hours of Robert O Smith on KOL and I never once heard him lose it on the air But you will here as he plays a new record by Hurricane Smith Bad enough he has the same last name without a saxophone that sounds like flatulence hence the remark about being self propelled around the track Tacoma shared Seattle s airport making it almost a suburb KTAC hired Robert O as simulcast AM/FM morning drive FM afternoon drive and Program Director With a night time power of 1KW on 850 KTAC AM could be hard to hear 850 was also then home to a station just outside Vancouver And at night 50KW KOA in Denver often caused interference in Seattle When it was not simulcast KTAC FM was Underground album cuts Today it is KMTT The Mountain the favourite Seattle area station for many of us playing an interesting mix of current and classic album oriented rock As always in those years KJR was the Seattle area Top 40 station to beat Ironically KTAC AM is now KHHO simulcasting Sports Radio KJR After KTAC Robert O Smith continued in Seattle

They re just gonna open the mikes and yell NINE !?! Epiphany A few weeks later we were joined by Pete Salant and Amos B Moses in the production studio at WALL and created the Nine tape under the influence of some refreshments which sure made the whole thing seem a lot funnier (We were later pleased to find we still laughed after the refreshments wore off ) We were supposed to write an ending to it but Jim Brownold (then production director at WPLJ/New York) got a copy of the work in progress from me The ABC engineers heard it dubbed off a trillion copies and Nine was out there The version they spawned was before all the processing and post production which I quickly performed due to demand We never did make an ending for NINE and as it turned out we never really needed it the whole thing is one big payoff So for the record here is the cast of NINE in order of appearance: Pete Salant Narrator Howard Hoffman Nine Double O Radio Good Guy 2d NINE jock Amos B Moses Johnny West Randy West Bob Roberts THE NINE jock Rene Tetro NINE Newsman A real WALL listener Excited phrase that pays caller The NINE jingle came from a WABC Old Gold 1969 jingle For authenticity the NINE news sounder was WWDJ s news sounder Don t Ask And to Mark Driscoll who now knows he unwittingly inspired this masterpiece thanks [CURATOR S NOTE: Jay Philpott made the original contribution of this classic to the Repository in early 1996 Howard Hoffman upgraded the audio and background a few months later In 1999 the original 9 production crew created 99 We are pleased to have been selected to present this Exclusive World Premiere ] [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository [g250 gif] TOP STREAM 32Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] There Buddy Jingle Demo 1975 (10:50) We proudly call this technique Crop Tops!

[Description by Robb Pirraglia] When I figured out I wanted to be a DJ I wanted to be just like my hometown idol Cruisin Bruce In fact my first radio work of any kind was to become his producer I worked with him doing oldies which were and still are my favorite songs My mentor and first PD John Morgan sat me down very early on and explained to me that there was more to being a jock than emulating Bruce He introduced me to Joe Niagra on WIBG Dan Ingram on WABC Jay Thomas at 99X and what is to this day my prized radio possession the Programmer s Digest composite of WFIL from 1972 with Dr Don Rose Jim O Brien Dan Donovan and the greatest of all rock and roll jocks (in my humble assesment) George Michael Nobody talked up a record like George And man did Ingram have wit  and Niagra related to his audience so well All this early listening was supplemented by learning radio old school it was 1993 and I was trained on cueing records bulking carts and splicing reels I knew that I wanted to be like Big Dan and George and do my thing in NYC one day and since WABC was no more I soon discovered Z100 My parents used to drive me down into Connecticut from time to time so I could hear it I remember how incredible Serving the Universe and all the other trademark Z100 formatics sounded I listened to my share of Kiss in Boston and PRO FM in Rhode Island and learned top 40 radio from the oldies guys who d done it and through old airchecks here at REELRADIO and listening to what was going on in the business presently Kid Kelly who did nights for many years on Z100 became an adjunct coach of mine I always wanted to be in New York I always imagined it and I always believed if I never gave up it would happen It did I ll never forget getting the phone call Scott Shannon talked with me and gave me advice on what to focus on It was incredible to do those classic Z100 formatics I always dreamed of Was I nervous? Yes but the people there are such pros the atmosphere is so creative and energetic thatI have to admit after the first couple of shows I felt totally comfortable and really had a ball It is always very humbling to me to be in that building and to look out the window at Manhattan and think Oh man this is market number one and I m 19 I just always keep the heritage of the station in mind I did the same at PRO FM There is a legacy to live up to at Z100 and I feel more aware of that than anything and how or what I can do here to make my own little mark on Z100 history I think I have always been a jock that does three shifts at a time You take me at face value you can listen intently and catch all my subtle shananagins or you can be a radio geek and catch me making references to Not Chuck Dunaway and the defunct WAPP I try to be the best of the old school and relevant to the new school of CHR (not TOP 40) jocks Personality wins any way you look at it and it comes out when you love what you re doing!

I d been a fan as a Kid but now there was professional respect and he became an idol In 1986 I finally made it out of the musty halls of public radio and to San Diego and K LITE where I was initially hired by ex 610 man Mike Novak Mike wound up taking off and by 1988 the station changed to a brighter AC Y 95 where I stayed till that July I knew I needed to work Top 40 to get it out of my system and hone my chops So from America s Finest City I moved to Oxnard and Q105 the FM sister and spiritual Top 40 ancestor to KACY The first couple of years I did nights and a countdown show direct from that rundown chicken shack that once served as home to Bob Eubanks Shotgun Tom and anyone else who passed through Oxnard between the mid 50 s and late 80 s Its safe to say I learned my craft amongst the strawberries and the alligator lizards By 1992 CHR had changed again Straight ahead Jock s jocks were falling by the wayside to those who sounded very young or very street After some frustrating attempts I decided to find a job where I could use my Top 40 style energy but it wasn t a Top 40 station Why not K Earth? I took a shot and got hired in 1994 Since then I ve had the opportunity to work with some of the biggest names in radio and it continues to be more fun than anyone can imagine The opportunity to have been on the same staff with my Idol the Real Don Steele and Robert W Morgan was a career highlight Their like will not be seen or heard again I wrote Shaune Steele after Don passed and told her of the impact he had on my career direction She s a very gracious woman The Repository thanks Dave Randall for sharing!

Two years later I had enough money saved up to buy my Pioneer reel deck for $430 (equal to $1 430 in 2010 dollars) I did a modest amount of recording with the deck Critical once in a lifetime recordings were done with the reel deck I first heard about Lennon s death from Howard Cosell during the ABC TV Monday Night Football broadcast That night KFRC said a littie bit more about it with Candice Chamberlain on the air expressing her sorrow for Lennon s death but also expressing her appreciation for the sum total of his work and legacy he left behind for us to appreciate and enjoy Being cognizant of the grim historical milestone of Lennon s death I sensed that Dr Don Rose s KFRC show the next day was going to be something different but I also had to be at work by 8:00 AM too So getting up just before 6:00 AM I cued up my reel recorder and recorded it at 3 3/4 ips so that I could get 90 minutes of Dr Don s show when I was not home If I had the luxury to stay home that Tuesday I would have recorded it at 7 1/2 ips for the best fidelity I did not know what to expect from Dr Don but I was not surprised how the show was handled I did the recording flipping over my tape reel just before leaving for work G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (9 Khz) [play gif] Dr Don Rose KFRC Tribute to John Lennon December 9 1980 Pt 1 (01:04:12) We ll have an interview with the interviewer Approximately 6AM 7AM: Dr Don Rose stops the Bee Gees and announces a tribute to our fallen friend confessor conscience and all the other things that was John Lennon Mike Colgan is featured with news G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (9 Khz) [play gif] Dr Don Rose KFRC Tribute to John Lennon December 9 1980 Pt 2 (56:03) all that great music we have and we ll have forever Approximately 7AM 8AM: Dave Sholin joins Dr Don Rose to talk about the last interview with John Lennon just the day before Rose takes phone calls from listeners G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (9 Khz) [play gif] Dr Don Rose KFRC Tribute to John Lennon December 9 1980 Pt 3 (01:00:44) we do what we must do say goodbye to John Lennon Approximately 8AM 9AM: We learn that Stevie Wonder was performing in San Francisco the night Lennon was murdered and presented a Lennon tribute to conclude his concert Rose closes his tribute The start of life the end of life and in between all those events that give John Lennon immortality The late Rick Shaw is heard as the recording ends [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 44 Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] Rick Shaw KFRC San Francisco November 22 1981 (01:32:05) Play Scoped This Exhibit SCOPED (24:10) I m afraid I m going to be saying we re here at Albert Brooks Hall or Foster Brooks Hall [iplay gif] UNSCOPED [iplay gif] SCOPED Rick Shaw is sounding great at the International Auto Show at the San Francisco Civic Center in Brooks Hall on Sunday morning November 22 1981 as the 49ers prepare to battle the Rams The R&B crossovers are a standout here but there are standouts from Diesel and Chilliwack as well 1981 sounds good on this aircheck and these guys were still doing some of the best Top 40 in the country [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] Jackson Armstrong KFRC San Francisco August 17 1982 Pt 1 (46:53) Play Scoped This Exhibit SCOPED (14:04) KFRC is on the road again [iplay gif] UNSCOPED [iplay gif] SCOPED Here s Jackson Armstrong operating from the home base in San Francisco while KFRC promotes being out and about for the Summer in their fully equipped remote broadcast vehicle The Virgin Sturgeon There s a second 45 minutes from this same date to be presented later Mostly this is very tight sold out format radio [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 44 Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] Jackson Armstrong KFRC San Francisco August 17 1982 Pt 2 (49:57) Play Scoped This Exhibit SCOPED (11:11) we ll warm it up for ya a little bit if you got your radio along with you if you don t how are you hearing this?

Fast forward to 1977: 50 000 watt Top 40 powerhouse KACY was buying KPMJ FM and one of the latter s announcers had decided not to stay on until the sale Not knowing what was going to happen but seeing an opportunity I moved to KPMJ helped launch a beautiful music format there  and got tossed out the door with the rest of the airstaff six weeks after we moved into our new studios at the KACY building But unemployment was not to last long because crosstown KAAP AM/FM had just started simulcasting The mom and pop owners were horrified once the simulcast began at how terrible it sounded (apparently they had never really listened to their own FM) But they had a solution: Program a contemporary station for 20 to 40 year olds and hire someone from that demographic as the PD My involuntary exit of KACY was their motivation to implement that solution and after about three minutes spent convincing me to come aboard I found myself in my first PD gig at the ripe old age of 22! We ended up being the first true adult contemporary station in the Ventura Oxnard market reaching 5th place among 18 34 listeners in the first book  with no outside promotion yet KAAP was sold in 1981 and I moved on to the APD slot at KBBY which somehow included an airshift on country KBBQ It was out to the Antelope Valley a few years later for afternoon drive at KDOL (where I also voicetracked middays at co owned KTPI) before returning to Ventura for middays at KMYX which had morphed from the KOVA that I had begun at a baker s dozen years previous to an Urban Contemporary format All of this led up to the part of my on air career I loved the most In 1987 Y 97 in Santa Barbara had an opening for a full time weekend/utility/production person and I was visiting with then PD Steve Smith just when he was looking to fill that slot Steve had a great instinct for what that market needed and his hybrid Urban/New Wave format was #1 for several books in a row when he left for greener pastures a year later I got plugged into his afternoon drive shift temporarily only to have new PD Mike Schaefer decide to keep me there The next book I had an unheard of 23 share (12+) only to get blown out by a GM who didn t understand why I didn t drop everything when an advertiser called me on the request line on the 4th of July wanting his copy changed (The station went completely into the dumpster the next book ) I somehow managed to get in with Los Angeles market rimshots KGIL and KWNK coordinating the latter s switch from satellite music to talk in 1989 before returning one last time to KMYX which had then gone album oriented country I did morning drive as well as APD/MD duties until it was sold at the end of that year Since then I ve done my fair share of consulting  the historic occupation of burned out programmers who had one too many gig that included on air work  and have put out a lot of fires without any fanfare or public credit But I d still put on my PD stripes again if the right opportunity came up (don t we all say that?)

KFRC did Did all the RKO stations have this?

From the snowy north to the land of palm trees and eternal sunshine In Canada my Junior High had a dress code Coats and ties were mandatory My first day of school in Long Beach I was confronted with a sea of junior James Deans White tee shirts black leather jackets Levis and construction boots seemed to be the order of the day It was like walking on to the set of Grease Neil Ross at KKUA Honolulu 1968 Neil Ross at KKUA Honolulu 1968 Neil Ross at KCBQ San Diego 1969 Neil Ross at KCBQ San Diego 1969 Neil Ross Head Shot Neil Ross 1980 something? Neil Ross with Randy Thomas 2003 Neil Ross with Randy Thomas announcing the 2003 Oscar Awards I went home and put the coat and tie in the closet where they remain to this day I began tuning around the radio dial and in short order I discovered KFWB Here was top forty music 24/7 played by the Seven Swingin Gentlemen a group of DJs who seemed to be genuinely enjoying what they were doing and didn t make you feel like a cretin for tuning in Reading up on the history of KFWB I now know that the station had only been on the air with Chuck Blore s Color Radio format for a matter of months Listening as a kid I assumed they d been there forever One year later we moved again south to San Diego When my father told me about the coming move he asked if I had any questions I had only one Will I still be able to hear KFWB? He gave me that pitying look I had come to know so well sighed and said Yeah I guess so It turned out that he was right I had to suffer through a bit of static but I could still hear color channel 98 In fact one winter s night I heard my idol Bill Ballance utter my name as the winner of a KFWB contest! Truthfully I don t think my entry was that clever I just think the folks at the five thousand watter wanted the world to know that somebody was listening all the way down in San Diego It was around that time that as I was listening to Ballance toward the end of one of his Saturday night shows He said that as soon as he got off the air he was going to jump into his brand new convertible pick up his gorgeous starlet girlfriend and that together they were going to cruise the strip I wasn t altogether sure what the strip was or how one went about cruising it but I knew that Bill Balance was having the life that I wanted to live That night the dream of becoming a disc jockey was born Gradually I began to discover San Diego s top forty stations and I began two timing KFWB I listened to KCBQ and The Mighty 690 XEAK from Rosarito Beach Mexico Then I discovered KDEO Actually licensed to San Diego suburb El Cajon Radio Kaydeo was the 1 000 watt David battling the 50 000 watt Goliaths Eventually 690 went all news and it became a two station battle Around this time KDEO was taken over by Tullis and Hearn and for about a year they had one of the most amazing radio lineups I ever heard That lineup probably was the greatest influence I had as a budding disc jockey I left San Diego in 1962 and never got to hear KDEO again until 1969 By then it had abandoned top forty for MOR When I worked there in 1975 it was AOR For some reason management gave up the wonderful KDEO call letters in the late seventies (what Arbitron diary keeper could possibly forget Raydeo Kaydeo?) Ron Jacobs cleverly snapped them up and took them to Hawaii where they remain to this day The station that was KDEO is still on the air now with five thousand watts and religious programming Eventually I got my chance to get in the business starting out at KMUR Salt Lake City Utah I also worked at KORL KGMB and KKUA in Honolulu Came back to San Diego to Work at KCBQ and KDEO I also teamed up with Gary Allyn to program two super powered Mexican FMs broadcasting into southern California in English as XHIS and XHERS After San Diego there was a year at KYA San Francisco then down to Los Angeles to work from KPOL/KZLA KHTZ KNX FM and finally a delightful ending to the twenty two year long radio phase of my career three years at Gene Autry s KMPC I never dated a starlet and although I ve driven up and down it a few times I don t think I ve ever really cruised the strip but I did have some amazing experiences and got to meet some truly unforgettable people along the way which more than makes up for it But as much as I loved it I eventually had to face the fact that the radio business was deteriorating (compared to today it was still paradise) so I left the air in 1985 and have been a free lance voice over performer ever since Anyone interested in that phase of my career can find out more at www neilross com The Repository thanks Neil Ross for sharing!

I m so glad the newscast wasn t telescoped What a time machine! Older listeners will recall when African Americans were Negroes the Ed Sullivan/Jack Paar feud the continuing soap opera of Elizabeth Taylor s life radio stations broadcasting Police calls and how about teenagers buying old hearses to transport surfboards!! Those crazy California kids what ll they think of next? Listen to Huddleston s timing on the half hour checkpoint it should be required listening for today s crop of mush mouthed news mumblers It isn t hard to figure out why Huddleston made it to KHJ a few years later Also heard on this aircheck are promos for legendary morning man Don MacKinnon I have tape of MacKinnon in San Francisco and L A but nothing from his San Diego stint Too bad You hear his voice on one of the promos which features a Lenny Bruce wild track Most of the spots are left full length I think they help to give the flavor of the times I telescoped a couple of the duller ones To most of you the Dr Free jingle will be an annoyance but to us old time San Diegans it s pure nostalgia baby! I m pretty sure that KDEO didn t have cart machines yet You can hear the popping and clicking of the ETs (That s electrical transcriptions kiddies not extra terrestrials)! Also in the quieter sections you can hear interference from a nearby Mexican station drifting off frequency Something we old time KDEO listeners had to suffer through Mel Hall continued on KDEO for a few more years after the time of this aircheck Why KCBQ never snapped him up is a mystery to me In the mid sixties he went north to program KRLA in Los Angeles and you can hear some of his production work on airchecks of the station from that time He then returned to San Diego where he was in advertising for many years I met him once when he came up to L A to direct a couple of spots in which I was talent At that time I had the pleasure of presenting him with a copy of this aircheck Mel Hall passed away October 10 2011 [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (9 Khz) [play gif] Don MacKinnon Wild Trax for Mel Hall 1961 (06:22) Hey you like the jokes on this show?

This 1972 aircheck consists mostly of his news and comment He read over the newspaper and wire copy and would staple stories to pieces of paper with notes to remind him of things and then ad lib a ten minute newscast which was frequently laced with his opinions and many humorous asides It added a whole other dimension to him as a personality and made him much more than just a zany DJ When political squabbles would break out local politicians would rush to call Aku to get on the air and state their case It is a hackneyed phrase and one he never used but if there ever really was a Morning Mayor in radio it was Aku His knowledge of and willingness to deal with local and national issues and his ill concealed contempt for corruption in high places made him much beloved by his audience I was always amused by his frequent use of Yiddish on the air and could never figure out what the various ethnic groups who made up his audience thought about it but he didn t give a damn This aircheck was made on a Saturday and you ll hear him make reference to the Jewish Sabbath (He was Jewish originally from New York ) We didn t think as much in those terms then as we do today but now I realize that Aku was really pretty conservative As you ll hear on this aircheck in 1972 he had to be one of the last people in America who still thought we were winning the Viet Nam War [combtn gif] Aku KGMB 1972 [rew gif] Return to the Repository About J Akuhead Pupule by Neil Ross Sadly J Akuhead Pupule (Hal Lewis) has been gone since 1983 and I wonder how many people in Hawaii even remember Aku Mainland radio folk who never made it to the islands in those pre internet days might have only been vaguely aware of him but there was a time when this man owned mornings in Hawaii radio He came to the islands in the mid to late forties His radio experience at that point consisted of playing fiddle in a country/western band that had a fifteen minute daily show on KYA in San Francisco The owner of the mattress company that sponsored the show noting Hal s deep resonant voice tapped him to read the commercials on the show This led to a weekend DJ gig on the station When World War Two ended a number of the guys working at the station decided to try their luck in Hollywood and invited Hal to join them But for some reason his wife insisted they go to Hawaii ( If we re going to starve at least let s do it where it s warm was what he told me she said) No matter how successful he became in Hawaii I think it always gnawed at him that he never took a shot at the big time Most of his old KYA buddies went on to great success producing TV shows and movies and I know he felt he could have done equally well I think he would have succeeded spectacularly His first radio gig in Hawaii was at KGMB where he was assigned the morning duties which in those pre television days was considered the least important shift In mornings he stayed as the car radio the portable transistor radio and the rise of television gradually turned morning drive into the most important daypart in radio Eventually he began buying the airtime and selling the commercials himself a practice known in those days as brokering It had two advantages First he made a lot more money than he would have working for a salary and it meant that since he was buying the time he could do whatever he wanted to and not have to answer to idiot f***ing Program Directors as he described them By the time the FCC outlawed brokering in the late fifties Hal was firmly entrenched as Hawaii s top morning jock and even though he had to go back to working as a salaried employee he was able to do it on his terms He refused to take direction and he wouldn t work cheap Unlike most DJs his years of brokering had taught him what his show was worth on an annual basis That s what he would charge to come to work for a station I ll give you huge ratings in the mornings you make the money off the rest of the dayparts he would tell prospective employers and keep your idiot Program Director away from me I ve got the numbers let him fool with the rest of the station Numbers indeed! Hal was usually good in those pre FM days for shares ranging from the high twenties into the mid thirties with awesome consistency The top forty stations would grab the teens and the rest of the stations would scramble around for the little that was left In 1965 after having worked for a number of Honolulu stations he returned to KGMB which had recently been purchased by the equally legendary Cecil Heftel It was reported that he had a four year two million dollar contract Huge money for that time and that size market He was rumored to be the highest paid DJ in the country How did he do it? Hopefully these airchecks will help explain Finally a word about his airname Akuhead Pupule is Hawaiian/Pidgen for crazy tuna fish head An irate listener called him that over the phone early in his Hawaii days He found out what it meant added the J for a touch of class and a radio legend was born Most of the time he didn t use the full name just referring to himself as Aku He was an amazing character and he taught me many important lessons It s an honor to present him to you G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 44 Kbps (9 5 Khz) [play gif] Neil Ross KMPC Los Angeles 1983 (13:24) No Dipping the management has asked me to remind you as you tango madly to the music of KMPC [Description by contributor Neil Ross] What a great way to cap the twenty two year radio phase of my career  Three years at Gene Autry s Station of the Stars 710 KMPC Los Angeles The better part of that time I spent doing middays following the legendary Robert W Morgan (featured on the Money Music Medley promos) After years of top forty and AOR work it was a little strange to be on a nostalgia station playing music that had been popular when I was a child and in some cases even before I was born But I relaxed got in the groove and did in my humble opinion some of the best radio work I would ever do I ll always be proud of the three years I spent on 710 KMPC [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository The Neil Ross Collection has been featured at REELRADIO since March 21 2004 www reelradio com Reel Top 40 Radio Repository ©1996 2011 REELRADIO Inc');

Drake hierarchy KYNO was a radio anomaly It had the finest equipment (the classic Collins board) and a wonderful control room  facilities well beyond the norm for a mid market station It was a palace compared to the rustic surroundings of KSTN in Stockton where Ted Kraft (Jordan) toiled before being hired by then KYNO PD Harry Miller (Eric Chase) Jordan is a fun specimen highly stylized not the

Only after seeing another Golden Gift on REELRADIO did I realize that I had something worth sharing and that s when I wrote Uncle Ricky All of my experience on the commercial broadcasting side of the mic comes from watching my Stepdad the late Tom Hally to whom this page is dedicated He played Big Band stuff and the accompanying photo was taken at WBRW 1170 Bridgewater NJ while doing his Sunday Serenade show Today I am back to listening to mostly spoken word (mainly news) with some oldies thrown in but things are not the same Skywave no longer has that travel to a far town mystique as one can often hear the same program in 5 or more cities When I m not listening to the radio I spend my time as an Engineer for NASA (in computers and communications not the rocket side) or riding my bike on the C&O Canal Of course I spend plenty of time with my lovely wife Liz (who thinks this old stuff makes me nuts) 73 s for now Dave Smith KA2GRL The Repository thanks Dave Smith for sharing!

Right after we are warned to stay in our homes the tower falls on the studio with a tremendous BOOM and he is not sure if he is on the air! Thankfully he is able to warn us to STAY CALM and that our ONLY DANGER IS before he is cut off WOW! Now THIS builds quarter hours! Let me know if I am still on the air will you please? One online source claims that WBZ AM was only off the air for 3 minutes This recording was edited before it got to the contributor and I don t believe it is chronologically accurate I do believe this recording was made from microphone to speaker (accounting for the background chatter) and at some distance from the station and that this copy was transferred from a noisy acetate But after all there were no memory sticks in 1954 [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 20Kbps (10Khz) [play gif] Joe Donovan presents Alan Freed AFRTS 1956 (29:10) a legend in his time LIVE performances from Count Basie and his Orchestra Laverne Baker The Platters Chuck Berry and Bill Haley and the Comets headline this lightning sprinkled genuine off the air aircheck We hope that Joe Donvoan will contribute the original recording (sans static) for our non profit Repository In the meantime our thanks to Dave Smith for sharing this treasure with REELRADIO visitors [Description by Dave Smith]: This recording of Alan Freed for the AFRTS was rebroadcast on Joe Donovan s Friday Night Revival on WHAS/Louisville on September 23 1988 Joe introduces it as produced for the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service in 1956 The program appears to be a highlight show as it was produced with many obvious edits It was recorded on a Hammerlund HQ 140X communications receiver in Kensington MD so the bandwidth and quality is subject to those conditions [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 0Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] Joe Donovan presents Tiny Tim Tindall KIMN Denver 1961 (21:31) The Station of the Stars [Description by Dave Smith]: This is an edit of the best parts of four or so rebroadcasts of Joe Donovan s Friday Night Revival on WHAS in Louisville Kentucky from 1984 to 1988 The equipment used varied as did the receiving locations (all over New Jersey and Maryland ) Each time Joe would play a different segment of his 70 minute tape with some overlap between each piece You will hear him announce that the entire aircheck was from 1960 but further analysis shows two parts September 1960 and September 1961 This is the 1961 piece only and it was recorded by me on September 2 1988 It features Tiny Tim Tindall on KIMN in Denver [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 20 7Kbps (8 5Khz) [play gif] Melvin X Melvin WMEX Boston January 31 1965 (08:56) you ll win an autographed coffee cup that was just used by me [Description by Uncle Ricky] When this exhibit was first posted we didn t know the true identity of the Melvin X Melvin on this aircheck I thought it might have been Game Show Host and Actor Jim McKrell but no one agreed He sounds a lot like J J Jeffrey and that seems to be the consensus (see COMMENT below) In addition to lots of PAMS (and a couple of time) jingles you ll hear Reverb On Demand and Jack Gale on production elements for the Secret Agent 1510 promotion Just a few months after this aircheck Gale (Fenway) joined ex WMEX Sales Manager Stan Kaplan at WAYS in Charlotte N C where Agent 1510 became Mr Treasure This is a rare aircheck from the glory days of Max Richmond s WMEX before WRKO was a Top 40 station [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 20 7Kbps (8 0Khz) [play gif] Dan Donovan WMEX Boston 1966 (09:09) The boss is very nice he gives me an extra added hour every Sunday [Description by Uncle Ricky] This recording of Tiger Dan Donovan on Boston s WMEX sounds as if it was made with the microphone in front of the speaker method The WMEX reverb sounds pretty good but the editing is not contiguous and hence a bit choppy Still this exhibit captures a lot of Donovan s polished high energy performance and a bushel of PAMS Pepper Tanner and CRC jingles You ll also hear a couple of classic spots several promos and station features It s all in this very intense 9 minutes a worthy sample of this legendary Top 40 station [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 20 7Kbps (14 5Khz) [play gif] Joey Reynolds WFIL Philadelphia May 1985 (01:52:48) supercarelessunrealisticandyoudiefromoverdoses [Description by Dave Smith]: This unscoped but edited recording of WFIL from May 9 1985 runs for approximately 10 minutes from the start of the show followed by a 1 5 hour gap with several smaller gaps later This was recorded while I was in college pulling all nighters for exams!

However when Dave Evans was about to leave he asked me to call him upon graduation from High School (which I did) and he gave me a job babysitting the KYNO FM automation system which was running Hitparade 71 That was my first radio job After many stints in radio in California and several periods out of broadcasting I moved to New Mexico where the air is clear and the cost of living is low I am on mornings with KCKN 1020 in Roswell And no I haven t seen any ET s since I ve moved here The Internet contains a lot of information on Bill Drake the RKO stations and Boss Radio but there is very little on KYNO the flagship station where it all began thus the reason for my contribution Enjoy!

GM Bart McLendon recruited his old teacher Rod Serling who recorded the host segments bumpers and custom promos and television spots Fantasy Park A Concert of The Mind Serling himself wrote the only disclaimer which aired each hour: Hello This is Rod Serling and welcome back to Fantasy Park the crowds here today are unreal And this one: This is Fantasy Park the Greatest Live Concert never held Broadcast in nearly 200 markets the 48 hour opus had college students hitchhiking all over America hoping to get to Fantasy Park In New Orleans when the concert aired the IRS came knocking on the doors of WNOE trying to attach the gate receipts to make sure the Feds got their cut! In 1975 I had the honor of accepting the Billboard Magazine Award for Best Syndicated Radio Special on behalf of the McLendon Company but complete credit belongs to Fantasy Park Producer Steve Blackson and Host Fred Kennedy who fleshed out the concept wrote it and produced it on primitive equipment This was truely the triumph of imagination over technology!

I was a 14 year old kid delivering papers to the studios of WRIG in Wausau Wisconsin when I was hooked Soon I had talked my way into an on air job with WXCO (Home of Mr X!!!) doing Wednesday and Saturday nights for a variety of formats I was a college freshman in 1969 when a few of us radicals talked the owners of beautiful music WSAU FM into letting us turn it Top 40 Renamed WIFC the station rocketed to the top of the market and has stayed there since In the early 70s I was finishing college at the University of Utah and was jocking for top 40 KCPX By the time I was to graduate I looked around at everyone I knew in the radio business and none of them were over the age of 30! Furthermore the guys driving the nice cars were selling not on air So I started selling for KCPX FM (AOR in the early 70s) followed by a stint as General Sales Manager at KRGO (Country) In 1976 I bought a Class IV AM station and rolled out one of the first AC formats with KPRQ (The Park) But man running a radio station that didn t cover the market was a drag! I sold the station and moved on to TV for years first at KUTV (NBC) in sales and then I put independent KZAR (TV16) on the air  before going broke with it I look at my experience with KZAR as my MBA When KZAR folded in the mid 80s Eric Rhoads (now Publisher of Radio Ink) put me in touch with Barry Ackerley and I got the best job I ever had in radio as VP/General Manager running the tattered but still legendary KJR/950 in Seattle We bought KLTX shortly after I got there Pat O Day Lan Roberts KJR and the world famous jingles ( KJR Seattle Channel 95!! ) were very familiar to me when I was 15 years old Having a chance to manage KJR was great! That experience is worth a book  some other time Since being retired from KJR in 1990 I helped Eric Rhoads launch Radio Ink magazine but I couldn t stand living in Florida So I came back to Seattle and kicked around doing all kinds of things until the Internet hit I started seattleinsider com launched a VC funded Internet company had an Internet real estate marketing company and as of 2007 I am CEO of eTAGZ Inc I truly miss radio but I have five kids and a fabulous family who NEVER heard even one of my air checks well maybe  until now The Repository thanks Jackson Dell Weaver for sharing!

Within a few years of this 1973 aircheck KCPX was a shadow of itself hurt by FM and an expanding metro area that favored big gun signals In 2007 the calls remained on the FM band but the call sign is now KFNZ/1320 a Citadel All Sports station [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] KJR Seattle Composite 1986 (06:47) Built on a Legend KJR had seen better days Much better days in fact when it was sold by Lester Smith (Kaye Smith) to Metromedia (Carl Bruzell) who quickly decided there were better ways to get a haircut They flipped it to Barry Ackerley who was expanding his billboard empire to include radio and TV For a cool $6MM ($4MM less than Metromedia had paid) Barry picked up a station with sub 2 shares Ironically KJR had far and away the most recognized call letters in the market  just no one listened to it anymore! This composite reflects the station as sort of a recurrent AC with lots of personality Gary Lockwood was probably the highest paid guy in the city (his deferred salary alone was in excess of $120k per year) doing mornings Marty Reimer one of the really smart talented guys in the market (now on KMTT) did mid days Ross Shaefer who hosted a local show on KING TV (and was later a replacement host for late night FOX host Joan Rivers) did an inconsistent job in afternoons and the legendary Pat O Day was pulling a short two hours each day from 5 7PM Sonics play by play and sports talk shows became the staple for evenings The hoopla regarding the upcoming Sonics broadcast was a harbinger of the move to All Sports a short time later This composite was a national sales tool for the rep firm [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository More to Come from The Jackson Dell Weaver Collection introduced on January 27 2008 www reelradio com Reel Top 40 Radio Repository ©1996 2012 REELRADIO Inc');

Nobody expected much to come of this experiment dubbed Beaker Street (legend has it the name is a drug reference LSD was mixed in beakers) It was the station s 50 000 watt nighttime signal blanketing Canada down to Central America and through the midsection of the U S which carried Beaker Street and the rest of KAAY to fame Concert promoters bought time on Beaker advertising events in places like Iowa where KAAY had a large share of the nighttime audience The show brought the likes of Pink Floyd Jethro Tull and Joan Baez to mid America exposing them to such music for the first time Why the background music during the breaks? It came into being because the poorly insulated makeshift control room was close to the giant 50 kW RCA transmitter and required huge cooling fans which made a racket The music bed helped cover the roar of the fans! (The music is a 17 minute acid trip called Cannabis Sativa by a group called Head) Beaker lasted until the mid 70s and was put in mothballs until 1987 when Clyde Clifford revived the program on an FM station in Little Rock Today it still goes strong as a Sunday night fixture on KMJX (Magic 105) in Little Rock [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32Kbps (10Khz) [play gif] Rick Dees WSGN Birmingham AL February 1974 (12:20) There s a Moon Pie I can eat that later [Description by contributor Russell Wells] Rick Dees first radio job was during college at WKIX/Raleigh NC Soon after graduation he was transferred to WKIX s sister station WSGN For about two years he pulled morning drive at The Big 610 but it was obvious Birmingham wasn t quite ready for this kind of radio At the time he had a running feature called Rev Billy Frank Birmingham (obviously carbon copied from Don Imus s Billy Sol Hargus ) and jokes about Vulcan Birmingham s famous mountain top statue Preacher parodies weren t very safe to do in the South during this time and Dees managed to offend more than a few Early in 1975 Dees left town and went to WMPS/Memphis WSGN though let bygones be bygones it was one of the first stations that played Disco Duck Dees #1 hit in 1976 [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 0 Kbps (16Khz) [play gif] TM City Song KGMO Cape Girardeau MO 1975 (01:34) We DIG it!

I wanted to be in a KOMA Band like The Rumbles The Red Dogs The Blue Things or the best name ever: Spider & The Crabs! In 1967 my family moved to Denver Not wasting a minute I searched the dial that first night looking for KOMA Instead I discovered KIMN and KBTR The Boss Jocks versus The All Americans! Personality Rock & Roll and it was all in My Town! At about 15 I decided to try for a career in radio My break came when some of us from my class traveled out to Burlington Colorado to audition live for the owner of a daytime AM KNAB Al Ross picked me and I stuck around KNAB for 8 years in full and part time positions while I took an unplanned detour into law enforcement (that s another story) The station got a new owner and went AM/FM I ran a Sunday FM board shift for many years with the full timers dubbing me The Disco Gestapo In 82 I ventured into the life of a retail business owner selling the business for a profit in 91 Money in my pocket ready for a change I applied for radio sales jobs and hooked up with KKPR AM & FM in Kearney/Grand Island Nebraska Eventually became Sales Manager but the fun part is that I m the emergency third string remote talent fill in on air once or twice a year and they let me voice a commercial on occasion (if it s for one of my own clients) In late 1997 I developed the 95 Fabulous KIMN Tribute web page As a fan I was disappointed that of all the tribute sites out there none were for Denver stations I took what souvenirs I had searched the web for historical background and names and photos lumped it all together and waited for it to be discovered Since then a lot of tapes photos and memories have been donated by former KIMN people and the page is growing steadily The Repository thanks Joe Wicks for sharing!

A mostly manly pirate with balloons from Landecker s ex A Boogie Check Premiere with Landecker s parents who testify that Records really is his middle name Americana Panorama and other quickie treats What you won t hear on this aircheck of 1981 WLS is anything resembling a traditional Top 40 music mix Surprisingly the playlist is all AOR crossover!

Survey Sheet featuring Mike Phillips Bwana Johnny The world famous Bwana Johnny as seen on WWDJ The WWDJ Collection [By John Porcaro] The Rock & Roll history of WWDJ Hacksensack New Jersey began on Wednesday May 12th 1971 when WJRZ a country station became WWDJ Top 40 a format which would be its cornerstone for nearly three years When WWDJ started it looked like it would fill the AM gap left by the demise of WMCA and in many ways it was (especially to those who only had AM in their cars) Although 97DJ was no MCA they still played more of a variety music format than 77 WABC One example was Chuck Berry s My Ding a Ling a song that hit number one on the WWDJ survey but was not played on WABC Unfortunately as in the case of WMCA it was another AM station with signal problems The first generation of WWDJ was similar to WOR FM It had a similar music mix with a little more energy and personality At first WWDJ unlike WABC seldom referred to its survey It played plenty of oldies and had a full time request line There were many excellent DJs who passed through the 97 DJ doors They included Bwana Johnny Al Brady (who went on to become Program Director at WABC) Mike Phillips (KFRC and KRTH) Ronnie Grant Howard Clark (who demolished a new Jaguar XKE that was to be a prize on The Big 610 out in California on the very first morning of the promotion) George Taylor Morris (who is the voice behind Reelin In The Years and the DJ who popularized the association between Dark Side Of The Moon & the Wizard Of Oz) Sean Casey (who was the last Program Director WWDJ had) Joe Conway Steve Clark (who was for a short time a WMCA Good Guy in 1967 plus on WOR FM & WCBS FM) Mark Driscoll (also of WOR FM and WNBC) Bob Lockwood Don Cannon (he can be heard on the radio in the original Rocky movie) Bob Savage Bobby Finck (aka Robert K Oliver or Rokko from 99X) and many more Sean Casey worked at WOR FM and WPLJ before DJ and then went on to work for a while at CBS FM Steve O Brien of ABC and WYNY fame worked afternoons for a period of time as did Jim King (99X) As 1973 ended and 1974 began the station dropped its all night show and signed off the air for the overnight period There was less energy in the presentation and the playlist seemed almost thrown together After three years of trying to battle WABC and the growing audience of WXLO and other FMs WWDJ Top 40 rode off into radio history WWDJ became a religious station on April 1 1974 The Repository thanks Mike McCann John Porcaro Russ DiBello Brian Nazario and Evan Dakes for their help in creating this exhibit [rmenu gif] [Descriptions by Uncle Ricky] Evan Dakes remembers WWDJ: I have fond memories of that ranch house that stands no more I recall the studios of WWDJ as a place that we as college students were able to go visit almost anytime We had become good friends with the engineers there since they built the radio facilities at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck just across the river This explained why we had such a good sound too We got a great up close look at actual radio being done and we were able to use that experience later on down the road We got to be known and trusted It was a perfect learning situation Some of us (not me) answered the request lines One went on to work for the Mets broadcasts Another Sharon Davis landed the supreme brass ring doing news and remained with them even

Between 1982 and 1992 I wrote and directed a July 4th Pyromusical Spectacular mostly in Sacramento (for KROY KENZ KSAC KSFM KHYL) but once in Anaheim for KEZY FM (1991) In all I probably did as much engineering in my career as I did programming I never enjoyed going to the transmitter on weekends but I never much cared for finding a replacement for the sick overnight guy either What I always did enjoy was planning and building It didn t matter if it was a new production room or a new format 30 years in radio and all I got was a website When Jonsson s last Sacramento station (1240 AM) was sold to former RKO President Dwight Case in October of 1994 I was excited about the chance to ask this industry icon for his recommendations for my radio career He advised me to seek a job in Cable TV I was disappointed beyond words I had hoped a man with his history would have more hope for radio I received about 25% of my annual salary in severance and wandered out into the real world unknown to a entire generation of broadcasters who changed jobs every 2 years (Everyone was terminated we were told the station would be Spanish Case sold it a year later to another group of South of the Border broadcasters ) Maybe if I had moved around a lot more instead of staying with one company for 16 years I d have a better shot at making a decent living in radio I worked with some brilliant consultants and wonderful talent I really do love radio  that s why this site is here Captus Networks logo For six years after I left radio I designed web sites for dozens of commercial and government clients I left web design behind and from January 2 2001 through March 22 2004 I was a Software Engineer with Captus Networks a tech start up in Woodland CA I hope REELRADIO will survive as my contribution to the radio business The business is allowed to forget me but the business should never forget the great era of radio that we celebrate here Note: Richard passed away on June 6 2018 leaving behind this radio treasure He was not married and had no children REPOSITORY MAIN MENU Descriptions by Uncle Ricky [ra30 gif] PLAY Alan Freed The Moondog WJW 1954 (5:46) Boy that stuff is really here!

The station went through some significant changes in the years that followed This exhibit survived as a scoped fluttery reel recording made after Christmas and before New Year s Eve 1968 In addition to Connor s upbeat delivery (inspired by Barney Pip a few years earlier?) there are PAMS jingles not the custom Heller tracks heard on WNAP airchecks from 1972 1975 [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible STEREO TOP STREAM 64 Kbps (14 Khz STEREO) [play gif] Mike Griffen WNAP FM Indianapolis IN 1973 (01:19:23) The Wrath Of The Buzzard [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Art Vuolo] Without a doubt this is the most aggressive (musically) and varietal (not diverse!) FM Top 40 station of the early Seventies I have ever heard at least on the rock side And we get to hear the EEEEE lectronic Mama jingle up front too There are long sweeps of album cuts that will require me to consult my AOR music expert to prepare the music reports (yes we pay fees to stream music please support us) Much of this stuff didn t break top 40 charts anywhere! BUT note the jingles ALWAYS into music still I m not happy with the stop set starting directly out of a music set definitely unusual for hit music stations with live jocks at the time Bonus: A full newscast with Paul Page is included The newscast (at 30 minutes in) may be where you realize this station was running REVERB on their program chain Yum! But what a strange LACK of balance what would otherwise be an Album Oriented FM of the period interrupted with Tie A Yellow Ribbon and Playground in My Mind! Wow this is almost surreal particularly with Mike Griffen honeying and babying me through all the male targeted rock numbers Or was that the Barry White tune? No unscoped version for this one you must listen and try to understand It was 1973 There was no satellite radio and the concept of a single format for everyone was still a worthy pursuit This is the last hour or so of morning drive and there s a bit of Mike Charles on the tail [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (16 Khz) [play gif] WXLW Indianapolis Wants to Give You 20 Thousand Dollars (13:26) WXLW Wants to Give You Twenty Thousand Dollars [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Art Vuolo] For those of you who haven t discovered our first WXLW exhibit you re about to be truly tweaked This is the madness of early 70 s Top 40 taken to the max with awesome imaging (they didn t call it that then) by the late Gary Gears Repetition Repetition Repetition! Steve Michaels and Bill Shirk (owner and PD) are featured here Hot Hot HOT! Great Top 40 on AM in 1974 Is it still OK to air a promo that says Write It Down ?

How bizarre that Drake s trendsetting FM stations in both NY (WOR years earlier) and LA (1974) didn t have the huge success that seemed appropriate Perhaps in both cases FM penetration (or the sampling methodology) simply wasn t sufficient to tip the diary totals [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (14 Khz) [play gif] Charlie Tuna KKDJ FM L A January 22 1974 (58:43) Everybody in the United States has lost an hour everybody except President Nixon who s lost an hour and eighteen minutes [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Art Vuolo] play This Exhibit SCOPED (15:37) SCOPED If all you want is Charlie Tuna the gags the (few) spots jingle and promo this version s for you!

And that Art Theatre spot is just too bizarre! At 48:36 you ll hear a CBS Radio commentary by a younger Walter Cronkite A lot of the great commercial spots heard in this exhibit paid for that and it s a win win for the listener at least with the advantage of thirty years If you don t agree well you ll need to stick around for the local news by Debbie Reynolds Honest It sounds like this one came right off the station s air monitor and we only wish there was more [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (14 Khz) [play gif] WXLW Indianapolis Has Balls and Un Contest 1974 (12:08) from the Mid America Mother [Description by Uncle Ricky contributed by Art Vuolo] Here s MORE of Gary Gears and Bill Shirk on WXLW from 1974 This exhibit is a composite of production elements for WXLW s Un Contest and Has Balls promotions and another SuperShirk aircheck It also includes the WXLW sign off (with appropriate editorial comment ) [combtn gif] [rew gif] Return to the Repository G2/5 0 compatible TOP STREAM 32 Kbps (10 Khz) [play gif] The 7:30 Tape!

Snippets of tightly sliced loud Top 40 radio are frantic adrenaline producing and scary! Yikes!

[By Uncle Ricky] This is a composite demo of PAMS Series 49A (for WLS/Chicago) and 49B (for WGAR/Cleveland ) Named The Modulators and produced in 1977 it was originally a WLS custom series and also holds the distinction of being the last PAMS numbered series The orginal PAMS went out of business in 1978 There s a string of jock jingles for WLS helping place the time these were used demonstrations of the jingles in use and a typical PAMS lecture on how the jingles should be presented Not surprisingly PAMS recommended that jingles should be used before music between music and between commercials  the more the better! There s a lot of stuff about modules and smooth flow starter modulators and how some are static in smooth structure I guess it was rocket science The important thing is how they sound on the air and we ve all heard sufficient WLS with these jingles to know they were powerful and memorable And there s a wonderfully funky version of the famous Copyright jingle on the end [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP STREAM 32Kbps MONO (13Khz) PLAY PAMS CUSTOM 14K Custom Jingles KQV Pittsburgh 1974 (05:19) 2011 December 04 Four Teen Kay [By Uncle Ricky] We have an aircheck of a few of these jingles in use at KQV Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in 1974 I know we bought cuts from this package and used them on the air at WJAR in Providence with J A R substituted for Four Teen Kay and that couldn t have been later than 1974 so this must be a 1974 PAMS demo from about that time Included in the PAMS tape box with this recording is a business card from the late Fred Hardy my favorite jingle salesman picture of PAMS box says Imagineered By PAMS This was a very powerful sounding package at the time with extraordinary performances Some of the acapella work (7 voice?) is the very best PAMS sound This demo includes a full line up of pseudo DJs including Joe Happy Sterling Quality Larry Speedway Bobby Bubble Jeremiah Black and Lenny Limbo This was intended to be a complete on air production package with exciting new electronic news and traffic sounders and a combination of speech instrumental and vocal representations of your SIGNATURE And that s the way it was back when radio stations were not afraid to sing their name [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP STREAM 32Kbps MONO (13Khz) PLAY TM Productions RKOverture Demo (20:10) [iplay gif] 09 November 15 a year round overture was just what I was looking for [By Uncle Ricky] This demo for the TM Productions RKOverture was delivered to me by the United States Postal Service sometime in 1979 News of the passing of Tom Merriman on November 11 2009 moved me to give it one more listen and to share it with you in our Production Room Charlie Van Dyke who narrates this demo worked briefly for WRKO (Boston) around this time and the station was apparently launching a new adult contemporary image with this fully orchestrated and undoubtedly expensive jingle package This demo is very generous with every cut and alternate versions in the clear It s 100% TM with big powerful instrumentals that would do any voice over more than proud [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP STREAM 64Kbps STEREO (13Khz) PLAY Tuesday Productions WHISPERS Demo 1977 (03:13) 09 November 08 and when you call try not to talk too loud [By Uncle Ricky] picture of the 5 inch tape box for WHISPERS demo I have noted before that Top 40 master programmer John Rook used whispering jingles at KQV in Pittsburgh and again at KFI in Los Angeles and here is the demo for Tuesday Productions WHISPERS and KFI in 1977 John Leader is out front on this demo I think these jingles would work with today s music radio There is no vocal group that can connect with modern synthesized ghetto music but if you can whisper the id think of the possibilities! Whispering is still popular even if melodies are now secondary to the beat As demonstrated here get a strong ID (KFI three syllables) and put whatever you want in front of it or drop it over the music you play it works! And it makes so much more sense than just playing songs back to back with no ID Yeah whisper it It s better than sittin there sayin nothin Or would you rather be an iPod?

As a lyric That Haunting Theme works just fine but so does any other 4 syllable phrase (ie: REEL RAY DEE OH!) Where have we heard this before? Was it used on television in the 50 s? It just has that kind of sound as if someone like George Fenneman should step up to the microphone and do some announcing This exhibit features INSTRUMENTAL PROGRAM AIDS first There are six cuts These are followed by seven cuts from the VOCAL PROGRAM AIDS On the Vocal side the artist is shown as HENRY JEROME HIS CHORUS AND ORCHESTRA On the Instrumental side it s just HENRY JEROME AND HIS ORCHESTRA I suppose some will insist these are haunting in the sense of spooky but I think not But some of us may have heard or played them on small local radio stations and that s certainly scary!

Feb 04 When four males sing they sound like they mean it [Description by Jonathan Wolfert President JAM Creative Productions and PAMS Productions Inc ] During the late 1960s PAMS made a concerted effort to recruit fresh young talent into the radio jingle industry It was the vision of PAMS founder Bill Meeks to be able to serve the younger end of the top 40 market with jingles that had more of a youthful rock sound while maintaining the classic PAMS sound for the more traditional top 40 and easy listening clients Jim Kirk (not the captain of the Starship Enterprise) was one of this new generation of singer/writer/musicians Between the years of 1968 and 1972 he wrote and was heard on many PAMS jingles including portions of Series 38 39 40 and 41 Hardy Kirk The Finest in Creative Production Tape Box Sticker Fred Hardy who had a radio background but always loved jingles joined the staff at PAMS in 1970 He handled sales for the Southeast US In 1974 Fred left PAMS and started his own company to work with stations and ad agencies He knew he could handle the sales but was looking for someone to take care of the creative end By this time Jim Kirk had gone to Seattle where he was doing commercial jingle work for Kaye Smith But he wanted to come home to Dallas So the partnership of Hardy Kirk was born The new firm needed to have a demo reel to send out just to prove to stations that it could do IDs So Fred contacted people he knew who might buy something from him on faith One of these clients ran KJIM (AM 870) a 250 watt daytimer in Fort Worth They didn t really know what kind of jingles they wanted so Hardy Kirk decided to make them a jingle all about the different kinds of jingles there were to choose from The idea was that it would be novel and of course there would be short mixouts to use as basic cuts The piece was called The MOR Overture The music for The MOR Overture was written by the late Wayne Harrison I don t know whether Wayne or Jim came up with the lyrics The result was certainly interesting but no station (including KJIM) knew what to do with it and most of it was never used anywhere The Hardy Kirk Demo Includes: * The MOR Overture * The cuts in the clear * Mixouts Vocal styles: * Mixed Duet Stacked * Male Duet * Four Males * Five Voice Mixed * Seven Voice Mixed For a variety of reasons the partnership of Hardy and Kirk didn t last more than a couple of years Jim returned to freelance status and contributed to several early JAM packages In 1978 Jim Kirk joined the staff at TM Productions In 1982 he co headed a new communications division to design and create shows for corporate meetings and presentations In 1986 Jim and Buddy Scott purchased the division from TM and began operating under the name Corporate Magic Jim has been there ever since as chief creative officer Fred Hardy came to work at JAM early in 1976 and was part of our sales team until he passed away in January 2002 JAM did buy some of the Hardy Kirk tracks including the Overture In 1978 when we were creating the original I d Rather Be In Denver campaign for KIMN I decided to use the individual sections of the MOR Overture as part of the package I wrote completely new lyrics and vocal arrangements and remixed all the cuts We had to create :29 versions too so that they d be usable under TV spots The JAM I d Rather Be In Denver series was very successful and was used worldwide Our thanks to Jon Wolfert of PAMS Productions Inc and JAM Creative Productions Inc for the story behind this Hardy Kirk Demo!

(unofficial?) demos that PAMS distributed in those days this was not narrated nor tightly edited as you will hear it here It was just a 5 inch reel with representative cuts presumably off the PAMS reference copy I ve only heard airchecks of KYA as a result of the Repository and I suppose it s possible that these jingles were never used on the air (or at least not as heard here ) This was a PAMS GRID package a new twist the performers did parts and then you mixed the parts to make bunches of jingles They had a ten track recorder in Dallas and they could jam up a bushel of jings from minimal sings with lots of things You could sit there with the friendly engineer and he d roll the same piece of tape over and over but each time do something different I watched Bruce Collier do that for a WECU session in 1970 You could walk out of a single session with many dozens of different cuts by interchanging and mixing vocal and instrumental parts I really don t care for the buzzsaw moog sig here but otherwise I have always been fond of this KYA Grid Demo KYA was blessed with a three syllable call A 3 note ID And this particular PAMS mixed group with this particular logo has always been a personal favorite For KYA the lyrical content seems SO classic particularly from 3000 miles and 30+ years away: In Beautiful San Francisco And the sleek Avco Broadcasting of California always sounded so warm and wonderful and respectable and so very far away Now I ve been there and was lucky to afford the parking [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP

KAFY but I don t remember finding these in my office when I checked in for PD duties Years before I arrived KAFY was a Big Boss thing north of 93KHJ Even with a directional kilowatt on 550Khz I got a call from San Francisco when KSFO (560) was off the air At times KAFY had a listenable signal over the grapevine in Los Angeles Genuinely Famous People who made a Good Living in Broadcasting worked at KAFY in Bakersfield Again I wasn t there during the Bakersfield Boss Era but these are (some of) the famous formula jingles Of course some of these were also heard for dozens of stations all over America (even ones that were not owned by RKO ) An interesting sidebar from Tracy Carman of Media Preservation Foundation: Though this package was produced and sold by Drake Chenault and though the Johnny Mann Singers may have recorded the first versions of the vocal tracks for some RKO stations it was suggested that these were not the Mann Singers COMMENTS (below) have challenged that The

Dec 01 Isn t it great to hear a new distinctive logo [By Uncle Ricky] Featuring samples for WYOO/Minneapolis St Paul and WFIL/Philadelphia this PAMS Regalogos (Regal Logos) demo was billed as the bright new success you need and indeed it was customized for a number of stations including Mike Joseph consulted WEAN FM in Providence RI in 1973 Great use of sonovox and top flight production

(08:18) 23 Sep 01 Fusion Flow Fusion Flow Fusion Flow [By Uncle Ricky] One thing I always appreciated about a good jingle demo is that it could demonstrate more than jingles  like the excellent production technique heard on this demo Oooh this one is nice It *sparkles* w/broadband This is a very nice demo tape for a fabulously popular jingle package produced and Copyright 1977 by TM Productions The vocal group(s) all sound like they ve pitched themselves in their highest range The very deliberate mid range ring on the verb and everything about this demo like the jingle package was freshly stylized and first class (And yes the demo uses records with percussion on the front but we are matching tempo *and* feeling now!) There are two narrators: One BIGV/O and one v/o There may also be another fellow cast as deejay (for KILT Houston) We will be looking to our comments for answers and of course comments [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP STREAM 44 1Kbps (20Khz) PLAY WJAR Providence PAMS Jingle Master Part 1 (14:57) 12 Aug 01 Yesterday Recycled for Today [By Uncle Ricky] When PD Dave Hedrick and Tom McMurray returned to WJAR/Providence after spending several days at PAMS in 1973 they had four 7 inch 15IPS master jingle reels We really liked jingles and had a huge jingle budget These are classic PAMS for Oldies formatted WJAR using the WABC signature Here are the first two reels First we hear male group jings including cuts from Series 27 and 29 Then at 7:42 the ladies join in for a few custom weather acapellas followed by cuts from Series 42 (The Igniters) Series 43 (The Textures) and Series 44 (The Music s On Us) The reel ends with cuts from Series 26 (Let s Go America) and Series 33 (Fun Vibrations) Broadband visitors will note the exceptional fidelity of this exhibit It s one generation off the master and I personally made the dub with perfectly tweaked Scully 280 machines on cherry Scotch reel tape 28 years ago [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP STREAM 44 1Kbps (20Khz) PLAY WJAR Providence PAMS Jingle Master Part 2 (14:54) 03 Nov 02 Try It! The New Nine Twenty [By Uncle Ricky] Here is a composite of Reels Three and Four of the four 7 inch 15IPS master jingle reels that PD Dave Hedrick and Tom McMurray delivered to WJAR/Providence after spending several days at PAMS in 1973 These are classic PAMS for Oldies formatted WJAR using the WABC signature 920 WJAR LOGO This composite begins with a blend of instrumental logos from an early PAMS series and some custom chants for the Try It campaign that WJAR introduced to Providence in 1973 when the station changed from an old line news/talk format to a Glitter Oldies format The billboard text was white on black and mysterious messages appeared on hundreds (maybe thousands?) of billboards in the metro area: Try It For Breakfast Try It At Work Try It In Bed Try It In Your Car and finally Try It NOW! with a big orange logo finally revealing the It as 920 WJAR Give Me That Old Time Music was a custom jingle that ran on both WJAR and WBT at the time Jingles for Morning guy Charlie Jefferds Sales Manager Howie Holland and Sunday Night Hall of Fame host Mike Ivers are all featured in this breathless quarter hour of classic PAMS jings It s capped off with a Golden Hours montage in tribute to the ancient SMC automation that played carts all night A cost cutting thing remember those?

The idea here is to destroy the previous key sense and move atonally to the next record Actually the idea was to sell some jingles and this 1974 PAMS demo tries to give shotgun jingles a good kick in the butt Putting the (very few) jingles themselves aside for now I remember this demo as way off target I also doubt that the simulated station on this demo (KHJ) actually used these jingles The Power Pack is the revolutionary evolution from the Shotgun Kick to the Sparkling New Idea Ouch! Hey it was never easy to sell jingles The final disappointment is the copyright notice on the end instead of re recording Copyright 1974 they re recorded just 1974 And gee it sounds as good as the original Doesn t it?

While others raved over the Johnny Mann Singers these were the acapellas that young Uncle Ricky craved some of the most perfect vocal arrangements you will ever hear My copy of this demo is as old as the memories and it contains a few unfortunate dropouts Still it s a great introduction to the different groups used for the majority of classic PAMS jingles [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] PLAY TM Beat Goes On DEMO 1968 (7:14) 15 Nov 1997 Here s the most dramatically formatted ID series ever conceived from Tom Merriman and TM Productions Dallas Texas circa 1968 At first I thought it was maybe 1969 but the majority of opinion says 1968 Seems early for such a great package! This presentation for WCFL is a good example of TM at its best The Beat Goes On was featured on many stations some of which are named at the end of the demo [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] PLAY The Drake Jingle Series Demo 1970 (6:11) 12 Jul 97 Drake Jingle Series Demo For those young broadcasters (like Uncle Ricky) who weren t privileged to hear an actual Boss station in 1970 this was likely their first introduction to Boss Radio The Johnny Mann Singers and of course the 21 Top Flight Hollywood Musicians who made radio history with what is one of the most sought after radio ID packages ever created The original demo distributed by American Independent Radio included a 25hz tone throughout This primitive form of copyright protection made it impossible to play the tape on automation ready reel decks and it slightly degraded the audio quality as well Nevertheless it probably didn t deter some smaller market stations from ripping off the instrumental tracks Here the demo has been edited to remove lots of dead air between the jingles and the simulated airchecks which include Robert W Morgan The Real Don Steele Humble Harv J Paul Huddleston and those memorable And now Ladies and Gentlemen introductions by none other than Bill Drake himself [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] PLAY Solid Gold Rock & Roll Demo (KHJ FM 1971) (18:00) 22 Oct 00 From Stereo One Oh One K H J FM the sound of Solid Gold Paper included in tape box Consultant Bill Drake had been experimenting with automated formats on RKO s fledgling FM radio stations for a couple of years by the time Drake Chenault and American Independent Radio released this tape The Solid Gold Rock & Roll demo is introduced by Mark Elliot and includes Drake (as the imaging voice) newsman Ken Marvin The Real Don Steele and Humble Harve We thought Robert W Morgan was featured with a cameo weather report but not so Our visitors helped identify all the voices (see COMMENT) A small piece of paper included in the tape box reads: The enclosed demo of Solid Gold Rock & Roll is an actual air check taken at KHJ FM Los Angeles October 27 1970 Music and commercials have been edited for your listening convenience We have since determined that the tape and paper don t agree This is KHJ FM but some of the songs used didn t chart until the Spring of 1971 [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] PLAY Changes PAMS Series 40B DEMO 1970 (10:48) 15 Feb 1997 Hey if your station s really worth savin PAMS changes the time and temperature syndrome with a fresh modern mover that sounds like a sunburst! It s the perfect pick up for ending a stopset! You can bridge two records with perfect pacing Slow to Fast! Fast to Slow! A subtle slide catches your ear and sets you up for an up tempo cooker! Clashing Contrasts are eliminated and your call letters are played electronically under the vocal for extra easy remembering! Featuring cuts for WABC KYA and WFAA this is a masterfully produced demo that helped PAMS sell many jings in the early seventies In listening to this today I wonder: Were radio stations programming PAMS or was PAMS programming radio stations?

Decipher the Rapper s Mumbled Money Message and Receive Righteous Reparation! Or something This demo supposedly features Dick Starr (PD) and Chris Edwards of KYA San Francisco First class production as usual  respectable PAMS magic We even get another sing of the Copyright Jingle at the end (Remember: All PAMS stuff is the copyrighted property of PAMS of Dallas ) [newcomment gif] [newrewind gif] [home gif] [burgdot gif] G2/5 0 COMPATIBLE TOP STREAM 32 1Kbps (16Khz) PLAY PAMS Revolution 72 Demo (KJR Seattle) 1971 (19:12) 12 Mar 2000 The Revolutionary Pedal Point Pad Hi fidelity long play airchecks of KJR (Seattle) are elusive treasures for this Repository so this PAMS demo titled Revolution 72 is as close to verbose hi fi KJR as we can get Always loved the KJR Seattle Channel 95 logo and it is performed at the top of the profession here A few years ago Uncle Ricky believed that the practice of placing imagers in front of commercial sets was mostly recent gangster inspired madness This demo reminded me that such wacky unconventional and flawed formatics were not only promoted but merchandised nearly 30 years ago Of course it s business as usual now but when one company owns all the stations and if all the stations make the same mistakes who ll know the difference?

Previous stereo material on the site has met with very litle interest (most of our visitors simply don t have the bandwidth) so you will just have to imagine the SFX are bouncing around Year? Gosh I dunno It came on stereo reel at 7 5 IPS and prolific Peters Productions in San Diego sent me more than one demo whenever it was Lots more stuff to learn about this one Narrator?

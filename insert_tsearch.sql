Close-Up of David Adams in 1988. David Adams, Age 17. Picture of David Adams in 2004. David Adams, 2004. The David Adams Collection [By David Adams] As the son of Bob Shannon, I guess you could say I was born into radio on April 2, 1971. Anyway, it certainly didn t hurt. Picture description follows David Adams at the KDWB transmitter, 1988 My first on-air experience was at KDWB Minneapolis/St.Paul, when the legendary Wolfman Jack picked me to voice a series of promos for his syndicated show. The line? Wolfman Jack is a gas!. I was just four years old, and he didn t pay me a dime. Talk about violating the child labor laws... But my first actual paid job came at the age of five when I co-hosted a KFI remote with my dad live from the L.A. County Fair in the spring of 1976. Since then, my journey into radio has taken me to KSBR in Orange County, News/Talk KRLA and History Quest Productions where I co-produce and narrate documentaries . A few years ago I came across an enormous collection of airchecks in the production room labeled Shannon, and discovered a few hidden treasures treasures including a station composite of KDWB and the Monkees at KRUX. The collection also included a collection of tapes labeled the Shannons of Top Forty Radio which included Tom, Bob and Don. Enjoy!! The Repository thanks David Adams for sharing!

[Description by contributor David Adams] Picture of Young Tom Shannon Tom Shannon wkbwradio.com Tom Shannon first joined the staff of WKBW in 1958 at the age of 20. He spent a year and a half doing weekends before moving into the 6-9 PM slot when it was vacated by Dick Biondi, who departed for WLS Chicago. Within a very short period of time, Shannon s youthful delivery and striking good looks catapulted his status to one of the highest rated jocks in the history of Buffalo radio. His Tommy Shannon theme song would go on to become one of Top 40 s all-time great instrumentals, when he wrote and produced Wild Weekend by The Rockin Rebels. This scoped exhibit features Tom Shannon s entire 6-9 pm show, composited from July 1961. It perfectly illustrates why WKBW became a broadcast legend. Shannon went on to work at CKLW before returning to Buffalo. In 2001, Tom Shannon was honored by the Buffalo Broadcast Pioneers when they inducted him into their Hall of Fame.

The episode was titled The Monkees on    Tour, and it begins with their arrival at Phoenix s Sky Harbor to the screams of thousands of hysterical teens. On the following night the infamous Monkee mobile is seen racing across town to KRUX. They storm the control room before binding and gagging the city s most popular DJ, Bob Shannon. Picture of Monkees in Control Room Davy, Michael and Micky The aircheck is a (partially restored) 45-minute composite of the two and a half hours that Michael Nesmith, Mickey Dolenz and Davy Jones actually ran the control board, spun the records and played all the commercials themselves. (Peter Tork wasn t feeling well and stayed at the hotel.) On a more personal note, not only was my dad featured in this episode, but my mom was too. Strangely, neither of them knew each other at the time, but whatever it was that finally brought them together, I ll be forever grateful! It was also during this show that the Monkees invited the entire city of Phoenix to join them at the prestigious Mountain Shadows Hotel for an open party later that night. Panic-stricken executives from both the radio station and hotel quickly pressured the group to recant their invitation. In an effort to avoid a disaster and bring some levity to the situation, Mike Nesmith is heard conducting an interview with the hotel manager, played by Bob Shannon. Picture Good Guys on stage at concert Bob Shannon and KRUX Good Guys on stage at the Monkees concert This aircheck may represent the first appearance of The Monkees performing collectively as Top Forty jocks. The concert, emceed by Shannon and the KRUX Good Guys, was held the following night at the Phoenix Coliseum on January 21, 1967. It marked the Monkees first concert appearance, and the final episode of their 1966 TV Season.

According to Bob, WKBW and it s outstanding line up of jocks like Perry Allen, Art    Roberts, Dick Biondi, George Hound Dog Lorenz, Fred Klestine, Russ    The Moose Syracuse, Joey Reynolds, Dan Neaverth, and Tom Shannon was    one of America s great radio stations in the late fifties and early    sixties. Tom Shannon had left such an indelible mark on me that when I    finally broke into the biz, 1 did the only thing a young impressionable    young jock could do Â I stole his name. Incredibly a few years after    finishing high school, I found myself living my boyhood dream when I    joined the staff of WKBW in 1968. Picture of Young Bob Shannon Bob Shannon, 1968 Shannon would go on to work for several other legendary stations like KXOK St. Louis, KDWB Minneapolis/St. Paul, WIXY Cleveland, KCBQ San Diego, KJR Seattle, and KFI, KHJ and KRTH-FM, Los Angeles. By 1968, much of KB s luster had worn off from the days when the great personalities graced the hallways in the late 50 s and early 60 s. But still, the station was energetic, fast-paced and tight, as displayed here by 21-year-old Bob Shannon during the Classic Hour from 11 pm to midnight. This was originally a studio aircheck. Bob Shannon himself restored all but the first song, in stereo. In addition to a few classic PAMS jingles, you ll hear an episode of Chickenman.

This exhibit first appeared as a Golden Gift on September 30, 2001] KDWB-AM began as WCOW in 1949 and was licensed to Lake Elmo, Minnesota with a 5,000 watt daytime signal and 500 watts at night. In 1959 the call letters were changed to KDWB when the station was purchased by Crowell-Collier Broadcasting Company, owners of KFWB/Los Angeles and KEWB/San Franciso. Under the direction of National Program Director Chuck Blore and Program Director Ted Randall, the format was immediately changed to mirror its two tremendously successful California sisters stations. [t_kdwb052563.jpg] KDWB Fabulous Forty Survey from May 25, 1963.

The first major air personality Changes came in in 1964 with the departure of Hal Murray, Art Way and Lou Reigert . The new lineup under program Director Sam Sherwood included Charlie Brown 6-10am, Don Duchene 10-2p, Jim O Neil 2-6p, Bob Shannon 6-9p and Randy Cook 9-midnight. Bob Shannon, 1975 Bob Shannon, 1975 From the late fifties to the late 70 s, KDWB was in a constant battle with arch rival WDGY, the Storz station for the Twin Cities. But by the time Bob Shannon returned in 1973 as Program Director and morning drive personality, KDWB was battling a second adversary, KSTP. KDWB Survey Cartoon, 1975 Front of KDWB Survey, 1975 A year later, Gary Stevens was named Vice President and General Manager and Buzz Bennett became Program Consultant. The mid 70 s also saw the birth of KDWB-FM, and this is a composite of KDWB, circa 1975. Consultant Buzz Bennett can be heard in various segments appearing as Captain Boogie. I (Bob Shannon) was the Program Director at this time; later, John Sebastian became PD. Of the six jocks on the composite, four of the six ended up at KHJ Los Angeles. After departing the station in mid-1975, Charlie Fox followed me a few months later and we worked together at both KFI and KHJ. KDWB THE ROCK and ROLL BICH KDWB Bich Patch A couple of years later, John Sebastian and True Don Bleu also ended up doing airshifts at KHJ. Sebastian also served as KHJ s P.D.

[Description by contributor David Adams] When Don Bombard began doing afternoon drive at WCBS-FM in New York, PD Joe McCoy suggested he call himself Bob Shannon.

(as of June, 2006, that Bob Shannon is on the Board of Directors of REELRADIO, Inc..) The first Bob Shannon in the radio business was Bob Shamrock Shannon (d. 08-15-2000), the longtime radio and TV announcer who worked for the CBS network in the 1940s and 1950s. 1320 WKTZ Logo WKTQ logo courtesy of Jeff Roteman.

It s obvious from this composite aircheck of Bob Shannon that the jocks at K-EARTH really knew how to have fun. Bob left KRTH in 2003, and went on to talk at KRLA for a while.

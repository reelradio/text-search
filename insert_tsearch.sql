Murray the K got started working for song writer Bob Merrill When Artie Altro was 14 years old he went to a rehearsal of The Perry Como Show at CBS Studio 52 While there his picture was taken with The Fontane Sisters by Bob Merrill who was not only a top song writer but worked as a utility man on the show keeping the camera cable clear Artie started in the business as a Disc Jockey (morning man) in August 1960 at WDOR in Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin After two years he moved on to WREB in Holyoke Mass for a short time then to WFAS in White Plains which was close to his home and close to New York City Artie says I studied acting for a while in New York before going to work as an engineer with WOR FM in 1966 when the FM s were being separated from the AM stations There I worked with the original 4 disc jockeys: Murray the K Scott Muni Rosko (Bill Mercer) and Johnny Michaels It was Johnny Michaels who got me the job We worked together at WFAS A lot of radio history was made at WOR FM It was the first FM station to play rock n roll and it was one of the first FM stations to make money In reality it put FM on the map Back then many people did not have FM radios The first anniversary party for WOR FM was at a small theater in Greenwich Village which later became the Fillmore East and the headliner on the first anniversary show was Jim Morrison and the Doors Not long after one enjoyable year programmer Bill Drake took over programming the station The disc jockeys knew they wouldn t fit and didn t want to fit in the Bill Drake format It was a very restrictive format in what they could play and what they could say The DJ s all quit and were replaced by people hand picked by Bill Drake himself I became supervisor and production engineer Every piece of production during the Bill Drake years passed through my hands In 1969 I produced a three hour Public service special about Childhood Autism The special won the Major Armstrong Award for excellence in FM programming and the AMA Award for calling attention to a little known illness One of the guests on the show was Ruth Sullivan founder and first president of the National Society for Autistic Children It was Ruth Sullivan and her autistic son that Dustin Hoffman spent a lot of time with researching his part in Rainman and it was Ruth Sullivan s son who Dustin Hoffman copied for his character in the movie In 1978 when radio was downsizing I was transferred to WOR TV which later became WWOR TV During my time there I was video tape engineer for Joe Franklin Morton Downey Jr Howard Stern and Richard Bey I have a good collection of out takes from these shows but because of copyright reasons I can t do much with them right now I first met Mort in 1954 It was at a Wallach s clothing store in White Plains NY He was a 22 year old cocky obnoxious kid He was 55 when I worked with him again at WWOR TV He was then a cocky obnoxious old man Some things never change Our thanks to Artie for sharing his treasures with the Repository

KBLA in Los Angeles before moving to New York and WOR FM in 1966 He quit on the air when he heard programmer Bill Drake had been hired When management heard him quit on the air the engineer on duty was called and told not to let him back on the air so that was it for Rosko at WOR FM Two years later he turned up at WNEW FM and by 1971 joined KMET in Los Angeles Mercer also worked at WKTU in New York in 1981 and most recently was working as the voice of CBS Sports in New York Murray the K and Johnny Michaels also left WOR FM for the same reasons Scott Muni was the only one left Bill Drake was afraid he would have to wait until the end of Scott s contract so he cut a personalized ID for Scott Muni which was never used because Scott didn t want to work the format either Something was worked out between Scott & management Scott moved on to WNEW FM in New York where he worked for 31 years He moved to WAXQ FM in 1999 for a daily one hour show and passed away on September 28 2004 William

cartridges (1972) CE Eric Small PD Sebastian Stone and Kim Olian are shown in the background Artie in 1997 Artie Altro today The Artie Altro Collection It s funny how things work in this business Murray the K got started working for song writer Bob Merrill When Artie Altro was 14 years old he went to a rehearsal of The Perry Como Show at CBS Studio 52 While there his picture was taken with The Fontane Sisters by Bob Merrill who was not only a top song writer but worked as a utility man on the show keeping the camera cable clear Artie started in the business as a Disc Jockey (morning man) in August 1960 at WDOR in Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin After two years he moved on to WREB in Holyoke Mass for a short time then to WFAS in White Plains which was close to his home and close to New York City Artie says I studied acting for a while in New York before going to work as an engineer with WOR FM in 1966 when the FM s were being separated from the AM stations There I worked with the original 4 disc jockeys: Murray the K Scott Muni Rosko (Bill Mercer) and Johnny Michaels It was Johnny Michaels who got me the job We worked together at WFAS A lot of radio history was made at WOR FM It was the first FM station to play rock n roll and it was one of the first FM stations to make money In reality it put FM on the map Back then many people did not have FM radios The first anniversary party for WOR FM was at a small theater in Greenwich Village which later became the Fillmore East and the headliner on the first anniversary show was Jim Morrison and the Doors Not long after one enjoyable year programmer Bill Drake took over programming the station The disc jockeys knew they wouldn t fit and didn t want to fit in the Bill Drake format It was a very restrictive format in what they could play and what they could say The DJ s all quit and were replaced by people hand picked by Bill Drake himself I became supervisor and production engineer Every piece of production during the Bill Drake years passed through my hands In 1969 I produced a three hour Public service special about Childhood Autism The special won the Major Armstrong Award for excellence in FM programming and the AMA Award for calling attention to a little known illness One of the guests on the show was Ruth Sullivan founder and first president of the National Society for Autistic Children It was Ruth Sullivan and her autistic son that Dustin Hoffman spent a lot of time with researching his part in Rainman and it was Ruth Sullivan s son who Dustin Hoffman copied for his character in the movie In 1978 when radio was downsizing I was transferred to WOR TV which later became WWOR TV During my time there I was video tape engineer for Joe Franklin Morton Downey Jr Howard Stern and Richard Bey I have a good collection of out takes from these shows but because of copyright reasons I can t do much with them right now I first met Mort in 1954 It was at a Wallach s clothing store in White Plains NY He was a 22 year old cocky obnoxious kid He was 55 when I worked with him again at WWOR TV He was then a cocky obnoxious old man Some things never change Our thanks to Artie for sharing his treasures with the Repository

When my first child was born on April 8 1967 Scott did a big thing about it on the air  an indication of how loose the format was then Unknown to us at the time the child was born with severe brain damage She lived with us for 16 years then went to a group home only a mile from where we lived She passed away in 1994 at the age of 27 from stomach cancer I have three other children born after her

KBLA in Los Angeles before moving to New York and WOR FM in 1966 He quit on the air when he heard programmer Bill Drake had been hired When management heard him quit on the air the engineer on duty was called and told not to let him back on the air so that was it for Rosko at WOR FM Two years later he turned up at WNEW FM and by 1971 joined KMET in Los Angeles Mercer also worked at WKTU in New York in 1981 and most recently was working as the voice of CBS Sports in New York Murray the K and Johnny Michaels also left WOR FM for the same reasons Scott Muni was the only one left Bill Drake was afraid he would have to wait until the end of Scott s contract so he cut a personalized ID for Scott Muni which was never used because Scott didn t want to work the format either Something was worked out between Scott & management Scott moved on to WNEW FM in New York where he worked for 31 years He moved to WAXQ FM in 1999 for a daily one hour show and passed away on September 28 2004 William
